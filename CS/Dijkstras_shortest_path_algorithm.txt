Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and A* algorithm:

Breadth first traversal is used for finding the shortest path 
between two nodes.
Similar to breadth first search, Dijkstra's algorithm is also used
to find the shortest path between two nodes. The algorithm is also
used for weighted graphs.
For example, if the nodes represent places, the weigths may present
the distane between the places or the time taken to travel. This 
algorithm is implemented using a priority queue.
The algorithm is also used in networking for routing packets 
through the shortest path.

A* algorithm, also known as best-first-search, is also used in case
of weighted graphs.
This algorithm is used to find the shortest path to a goal node.
This algorithm is used in maps to find the shortest distance between
the source and destination.
Best-first search is a pathfindin algorithm used in computer science
and artificial inteligence to find the most promosing path to a 
goal. It uses a heuristic function to decide which node to explore
next.

A heuristic is like a smart guess.
It doesn't guarantee the perfect answer, but it helps you get a 
good enough answer quickly.

In A* algorithm, two cost functions are used to calculate the cost
of nodes:
	g(x): A real cost function similar to the one implemented 
	in Dijkstra's algorithm.
	h(x)L A heuristic function that calculates the approximate
	cost of the goal node from the node x. The cost should not
	be overesitmated. Hence, g(x) >= h(x).
	The total cost, f(x) = g(x) + h(x)
