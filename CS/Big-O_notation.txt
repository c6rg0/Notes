Big O notation:

Big O gives us a worst-scenario for the runtime of an algorithm.

We measure as algorithm based on the size of the data set that it
inputted to it.
The data could be as small as a set containing one binary digit,
to a set containing all of the words from every language in the
world.
In most cases, as the data set increases in size, so does the 
runtime.

Big O is written as a function, like this:
	O(n)
In this instance, the run time of the algorithm is directly
proportional to the size of the input. So an input size of 10 
would have a runtime of 10; an input of 20 would have a runtime
of 20.
	O(2n)
Here, the runtime will always be twice the size of the input data.
An input size of 10 would have a runtime of 20.

Different algorithms produce runtime values of radically varying
quantities.
The adjacent graph highlights how changing the size of an input
set affects the runtime for five key types of algorithms.
