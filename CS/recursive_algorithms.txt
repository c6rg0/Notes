Factorials:
Example: 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1
5! (spoken 5 factorial) is a shorthand way of expressing the 
product of number 1 to 5.
Note also that 0! = 1 by defenition

Recursion:
The factorial function is a good example of a function that can
be defined in terms of itself.
n! = n x (n - 1)!
Recursion is a very powerful technique in programming.

- Python recoursive routine example:
# start python
def calc(n):
	if n == 0:
		factorial = 1
	else:
		factorial = n * calc(n - 1
	print(factorial)
	return 
# end python

- How does the code work?
  Each time the subroutine is called, the return address, parameter
  and local variables, parameter and local variables are pushed 
  onto the stack.
  Statement 6 is not reached until the routine is called with n = 0
  , then 0! = 1 is output.

Essential characteristics:
  A recursive routine has three essential characteristics:
    - A stopping condition or base case must be included which
      when met means that the routine will not call itself and
      will start to "undwind".
    - For input values other than the stopping condition, the 
      routine must call itself.
    - The stopping condition must be reached after a finite number
      of calls.

The use of the call stack:
  Every time a subroutine is called, the return address (the line
  after the call statement) is put on the call stack.
  Even with a stopping condition, the recursive routine can only
  be called a limited number of times or the stack will overflow
  the maximum memory capacity.
  If the calcSum subroutine is called with a large number, say 
  1000, the program may crash with the same message:
    [RuntimeErrorL maximum recursion depth exceeded]

Tree traversal algorithms:
  Recalll that there are three ways of traversing a tree:
  pre-order, in-order and post-order.
  The prefixes pre-, in-, or post- refer to whether the root is
  visited before, between or after the nodes of the subtree.

Algorithms for tree traversal:
  A tree is defined in terms of a root, a left subtree and a right
  subtree.
  Each subtree is itself a tree.
  A recursive routine is a very neat way of traversing a tree.
