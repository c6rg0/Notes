# Sets (regular languages)

- Sets formalise the idea of grouping objects together and
  viewing them as a single entity.
- In this way, a set becomes an abstraction.

- A set is a well-defined collection of objects:
    - Objects in the set are members or elements,
    - A set is unordered
    - Each member in a set can only occur once
- A set is usually denoted by a capital leter
    - A member is usually denoted with a lower case letter

## Common sets
- N = set of natural numbers: 0,1,2,...
- Z^+ = set of positive integers: 1,2,3,...
- Z = set of all integers: ...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...
- Q = set of rational numbers (can be described as a fraction)
- R = set of real numbers

- ∈ = "a member of the set ..."
- X ∈ N - X is a member of the set N
- | = "such that"
- ^ = "and"
- ... is even = the constraint for the "and"

X is such that X is a member of the set N and X is even

- Union:
    - A ∪ B is a set of all members that are in A or in 
      B or in both.

- Intersection:
    - A ∩ B is the set of all members in both A and B

- Difference:
    - A \ B in the set of all numbers that are in A but not
      in B

## Subsets
- A is a subset of B, when every member of A is also a member
  of B:
    - A ⊆ B.
- A is not a subset of B, if at least one member of A is
  not a member of B:
    - A ⊈ B.
- A is a proper subset of B, when A is a subset of B but 
  A != B:
    - A ⊂ B.

## Cartesian product
- The cartesian product of two sets A and B is the set of all
  ordered pairs (a, b), such that a ∈ b and b ∈ b.
- Cartesian product notation:
    - A x B, read as "A cross B".


## Cardinality
- The cardinality of a finite set it the number of elements
  in a set.
- The cardinality of a set A is denoted by |A|.
    - The cardinality of the set A, where A = {2,4,6,8} is 4.
    - If B = {1,3,5}, |A ∪ B| = 7

## Set concepts
- A finite set containes an exact number or distinct members
  where member (arabic letter) N:
    - The English alphabet is a finite set which has 26 
      distinct members.
    - Alphabet = {a,b,...,Z}
- The cardinality of a finite set is the number of members in
  the set.
    - The cardinality is written as |X|, where X is a set.
    - |{a, b, ..., z}| = 26.
    - |Alphabet| = 26.

- An infinite set contains an infinite number of distinct 
  members,
    - Both N and R are infinite sets.
- A countably infinite set is one whose member can be counted
  using the infinite set N,
    - The set of integers divisible by 5 {0,5,10,15,...} is 
      an infinite set.
    - Each member can be assigned a positional value from set
      N.
    - Member 1 = 0, member 2 = 5, member 3 = 10, ...
      Therefore, it is a countable infinite set.
    - The set R, is not countable.
