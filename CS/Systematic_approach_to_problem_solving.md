# NOTES TAKEN FROM PG ONLINE TEXTBOOK/POWERPOINTS

# Unit 11: Databases and software development
# Systematic approach to problem solving

## Analysis
- Before a problem can be solved, it must be defined. The
  requirements of the system that solved the problem must
  be established. In the case of data processing system,
  or for example the construction of a website, this could
  cover:
    - The data - its origin, uses, volumes and characteristics
    - The procedures - what is done, where, when and how
    - The future - development plans and scaling capabilities
    - The problems with any existing system

## Agile modelling
- At all the stages of analysis, design and implementation,
  an agile approach may be adopted, as the stages of 
  software development may not be completed in a linear
  sequence.
