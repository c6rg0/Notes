Task 1:
1. Describe three ways in which a vector can be represented:
   - As a list of numbers
   - As a function
   - As a geometric point in space

2.
 (a) 0 => 1
     1 => 2
     2 => 3

 (b) [0:1, 1:2, 2:3]

 (c) Two vector over the set of real numbers (2 vector over R)

 (d) ...

 (e) [0, 1, 2, 3]

3.
 (a) (3, 3)

 (b) (0 + 3) (2 + 1) = (3, 3)

6.
 (a) [7 x 4] [2 x 3] = [28, 6]
     28 + 6  = 34

 (b) 34 ...
