Trees:

Abstraction:
- A tree is a common abstract data type (ADT)
	- Like a tree in nature, a tree data structure has a root,
	  branches and leaves.
	- The difference is that in computer science, the trees
	  root is at the top.

A tree is a connected, undirected graph with no cycles (there is
no unique path from each node to any other node).


Traversing a binary tree:
- Pre-order: Visit the root, then traverse the left sub-tree, then
  the right sub-tree.

- In-order: Traverse the left sub-tree, then visist the root, then
  traverse the right sub-tree.

- Post-order: Traverse the left sub-tree, then traverse the 
  right-tree, then visit the root.


A balanced binary tree:
- A balanced tree is one where the nodes are ditributed in such a 
  way that the height is kept to a minimum.
	- This allows more effiecient searching.

- A binary tree may be represented as an array of records, or a 
  two dimensional list.
- A pointer can be used to indicate if there is or isn't a subtree
  on a (certain) side.
