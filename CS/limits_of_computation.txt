Limits of computation:

A problem is defined as being computable if there is an algorithm
that can solve every instance of it in a finite number of steps.

A computational problem is a task or question that can be solved
using a computational process (i.e. an algorithm). It typically has:
- Input: A set of valid data or conditions,
- Outputs: A desired result or solution,
- Rules: A method or algorithm that transforms the input into the 
         output.

Non-computable problems:
These are problems for which no algorithms can solve them for all
possible inputs.
Example:
The Halting Problem; determining whether any given program will
eventually stop or run forever.

TSP = traveling salesman problem

Solving the TSP:
The problem quickly becomes impossible to solve within a reasonable
time.
Even with only 10 cities, there are more than three possible routes.
With 50 cities, the number of possible routes is a 65-digit number!
This is an example of an interactable problem:
	It has a time complexity O(n!)

Tracable problems:
A problem that has a polynomial-time soltuion or better is called 
a tracable problem.
