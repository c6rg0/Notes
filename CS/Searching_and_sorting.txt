Linear search:
- The only systematic way of finding out is to look at each card, 
  starting with the first card, until you find your item.

Binary search:
- The binary search is a very efficient way of searching a sorted
  list.
  Steps:
    - Examine the middle item in the list,
    - If this is the one you're searching for, return the index,
    - Elimenate half the list, depending on whether the item being
      sought is greater or less than the middle item,
    - Repeat until the item is foudn or is proved to be not in the
      list.

Merge sort:
- The merge sort is more efficient than the bubble sort.
- The steps are:
    - Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing
      one element.
    - Repeatedly merge two sublists at a time to produce new
      sorted sublists until ther is only one sublist remaining.
      This is the sorted list.
