- The merge sort is more efficient than the bubble sort.
- The steps are:
    - Divide the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing
      one element.
    - Repeatedly merge two sublists at a time to produce new
      sorted sublists until ther is only one sublist remaining.
      This is the sorted list.
