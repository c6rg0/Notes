Graphs (12/9/25):

A graph is an abstract data structure representing complex 
relationships.

Vertices:
Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph. 
Sometimes, vertices are also known as vortex or nodes. 
Every node/vertex can be labeled or unlabelled.

Edges:
Edges are drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph. It can 
be ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph. Edges can connect 
any two nodes in any possible way. 
Sometimes edges are also called arcs.

Undirected Graph: 
There are no arrows on the edges indicating direction.

Weighted graph:
A graph in which the edges are alreadt specified with 
suitable weight.

Representing a graph:
A graph can be implemented in one of two ways:
- Adjacency matrix
- Adjacency list

- Insertion or deletion of nodes in a graph
- Insertion or deletion of edges
- Searching in the Adjacency
