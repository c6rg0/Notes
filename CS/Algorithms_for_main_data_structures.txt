Algorithms for main data structure:

Depth-first traversal:
In depth-first traversal, when a route is considered, nodes are
followed until the bottom is reached. When there are no more 
nodes in a route, the route is backtracked, i.e. visiting the same
nodes in reverse. When all the unvisisted nodes are traversed in 
a route, the next route is considered. Usually, the traversal
starts from the leftmost route.
Depth fiest traversal is implemented using a stack. Both recursive
and non-recursive approach may be used.

Breadth-first traversal:
In breadth-first traversal, the neighbours of a node are visited
in order. This search starts from the source. The neighbours
of the first node are visited, and so on. This traversal takes
place layerwise.
Breadth-first traversal is implemented using a queue.

Tree-traversal:
- A depth-first traversal of trees is the pre-order traversal of 
  trees. Similar to graphs, this may also be implemented using
  stacks.
- A breadth-first traversal of trees is implemented using a queue.
