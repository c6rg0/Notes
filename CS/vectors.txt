Abstraction involved constructing a model that represents only a 
part of reality that we are interested in.
It ignores irrelevant detail in the real-world phenomenon of 
interest.
An abstract data type (ADT) is a logical view of the data and
possible operations.
An ADT can help us design algorithms to solve real-world problems.

A scalar mathmatical quantity has magnitude only.
A vector mathematical quantity has both magnitude (length) and 
direction.

Why use vectors?
   Vector graphics and 3D graphics:
      Images are defined as paths, not distinct bit patterns
      Rules of mathematics allow scaling without distortion
   Computer games/Simulations:
      The combination of moving forces, represented by vectors, 
      can be resolved into a single path by using the same 
      mathematical rules.
   Multiple dimensions:
      Can represent 2, 3 or more dimensions.

Notation used for a 2 vector:
   As an arrow:
      From the origin (0, 0) to the point (4, 3)
   A 2-vector over R, where R is the set of real numbers:
      [4.0, 3.0]
      R^2 (A-2 vector)
      All entries must be from R
   Example:
      A path in a vector graphic

Notation (3-Vector):
   As an arrow:
      From the origin (0, 0, 0) to the point (ax, ay, az) in 3d
      space.
   A 3-vector over R, where R is the set of real numbers:
      [4.76, 3.0, 2.03]
      R^3
      All entries must be from R
   Example:
      A point in space representing an asteroid in a computer game.

Notation (4-vector)
   A 4-vector over R, where R is the set of real numbers
      [7.843, 4.254, -3.567, 2.0]
      R^4
      All entries must be R
   Example:
      A 4 dimensional spacetime
      A 3-vector over R, degined (x, y, z) and a 4th dimension as
      time.
      [x, y, z, t]

Notation - function:
   In order to translate from mathematical notation to a notation
   more useful in programming, we use a 'map' function.
   The notation S => R means 'S maps to R'
   A vector can be used as a location indicator, where
      S = {0, 1, 2, 3} maps to [2.55, -3.88, 4.11, 5.77]
      0 => 2.55
      1 => -3.88
      2 => 4.11
      3 => 5.77

Vector representation in Python:
   In Python, the list is the preferred representation.
   A R^2 could be defined as:
      vector2 = [6.34, 98, 75]

A vector viewed as a function:
   In python, a dictionary may be used, so for example an R^4 
   could be represented as:
      dict4 = {0:6.12, 1:-7,34, 2:-8.45, 3:9.02}

Vector addition:
   The vector sum (a+b) is found by relocating b so that head 
   touches tail (translation)
   Add vectors by adding the x- and y-parts seperately.
   The red vector has a direction of (5,1)
   The red vector has a magnitude of square-root(5^2 + 1^2)
   In effect, addition is translation because of the shifting of
   the vector.

Exercice:
   A = (4, 0), B = (3, 4) 
   What is C = A + B?
   (4 + 3) and (0 + 4) = (C = (7, 4))

Dot product:
   A method for multiplying 2 vectors
   Written by using a dot
   Multiply corresponding components of each vector
   U . V = U^1 V^1 + U^2 V^2 + U^2 V^3 + ... U^n V^n
   Usage:
      One vector contains unit prices, another vector contains
      numbers solf, then dot product gives amount of money taken.
      Finding the angle between two vector.

Angle between two vectors:
   The lengths of the vectors can be written in mathematical
   notation as:
      ||U|| and ||v||
   The formula for finding the angle (0/ = circle with a line going) 
   between u and v is:
      cos 0/ = (u . V) / (||U|| . ||V||) 

   Graphic programmers often need to find the angle between two
   vectors.
   The dot product may be used to do this.
