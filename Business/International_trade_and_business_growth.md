# 4.1.2 International trade and business growth

## Imports
- Goods and services that are brought into one country from
  another.
- The UK is only a small island so we need to bring in goods
  from other countries that we might need. This is called 
  importing.
- Some countries specialise in producing certain goods, and 
  with their low labour costs thet can make products at more
  attractive prices than we can in the uk.

## Exports
- Goods or services that a firm produces in its home market,
  but sells in a foreign market.
- All countries trade with other countries, they send products
  abroad. This process is called exporting.
- The UK exports:
    - Medical supplies,
    - Cars,
    - Gas turbines,
    - And gold

## Specialisation 
- When an economy or a business concentrate on a specific 
  range of products or services.
- Specialisation is the process of concentrating on and 
  becoming expert in a particular subject or skill. It
  means that a country will have industries in which it
  leads the world. This may be due to; proximity of raw
  materials, low labour costs, historical ability or other
  factors e.g. Belgian chocolate, Scotch wisky etc.

## Comparitive advantage
- Explains how individuals, businesses or countries benefit
  from specializing in what they are relatively best at.

## Specialisation and comparative advantage
- A country may decide to specialise in a particular industry
  or sector.
- For example, india specialises in IT due to huge number of
  graduates from its universities.
- This means they can set up call centres for overseas 
  companies staffed by English speaking graduates who are on 
  a fraction of the wages required in the UK.

## Benefits of specialisation
- Increased productivity and output, this means reduced
  average costs and economies of scale.
- As more resources are devoted to the industry rather than 
  being spread out the scale of production can be increased
  to gain economies of scale.
- This gives the industry comparative advantage over other
  countries.
- The increased productivity will lead to GDP growth and 
  increasing sales will boost economic growth.

## Drawbacks of specialisation
- A country may become over reliant on one industry, and 
  this does not spread risk.
- Other countries may become cheaper in the same industry
  and it may be harder to compete.
- If the business grows too big it may suffer from 
  diseconomies of scale through lack of communication and 
  co-ordination.

## FDI
- Foreign direct investment (FDI) is the purchase of a 
  foreign company or setting up production in another 
  country. It is the movement of cash from one country to 
  another via a business venture.
- When a business invests by setting up operations or buying
  assets in business in another country.

- FDI is foreign direct investment which means money from one
  country that is put into another country:
    - FDI could be through building a new factory in another
      country.
    - FDI could also be through an acquisition or merger with
      a foreign company.
    - FDI could be through investment in an existing foreign 
      company.

## FDI and business growth
- MNCs may decide to build factories or other business preises
  which will create jobs for the host nation e.g. Microsoft, 
  Facebook and Amazon have all setup in India.
- FDO means a business decision to acquire a substantial 
  stake in a foreign business or to buy it outright in order 
  to expand its operations to a new region.

## Benefit to FDI to nations
- FDI investment in business in another country means jobs 
  and employment for that nation.
- This means that employees now have disposable income to 
  spend in shops and on services.
- This is a boost to the economy and is known as the 
  multiplier effect.
