Explain 1 reason why global niche markets may be important
to a game developer, such as Sukeban Games.

One reason why global niche markets may be important to a
game developer is because risk may be reduced. When games no
longer cost a new console to play, and with internet game 
storefronts, Sukeban games could spread risk across markets by
translating and publishing into different languages. Also
considering that 2.2 billion customers played computer games,
where as individual countries player counts are significantly
lower, distributing to a larger pool of consumers is the
better choice, especially when there is little downsize or
risk doing so.
