## Appreciation and exports
- If the pound appreciates, gets stronger against other currencies, then UK exports to other countries will be more expensive
  for the customers in those countries.
- This may mean that the business that exports, out of the UK, has lower sales or may have to reduce their prices in other 
  countries to keep demand levels up.

## Appreciation and imports
- As the pound appreciates - gets stronger - against other currencies, then imports to the UK will be cheaper.
- Businesses that sell imports will have lower costs, and therefore may enjoy higher profits.

## Depreciation and exports
- If the pound depreciates - gets weaker against other currencies - it will make exports to those countries cheaper.
- The business can decide to either:
    - Keep products to other countries the same and enjoy the higher profit,
    - Lower prices to other countries and gain market share and more revenue from extra sales.

## Depreciation and imports
- If a business imports while there is no depreciation, it will make those imports more expensive to buy.
- If the imports are raw materials to make other products in the UK, then these products will cost more to make and be expensive
  for the consumer, which may affect demand, sales revenue and profit.

## Competetive advantage
- "A competetive advantage is an advantage over competitors by offering consumers greater value, either by means of lower prices
  or by providing greater benefits and services that justifies higher prices."; Micheal Porter (1985).

### 1. Low-cost leadership
- With this strategy, a business will seek to produce the same quality products as its competitors at a lower price.
- The industries typical of this strategy are standard mass-produced items.
- Large businesses typically do well as they can benefit from the largest reduction in average costs and economies of scale.
- They may gain cost leadership due to:
    - Good resource management,
    - Efficient production methods,
    - Waste minimisation.

### 2. Differentiation
- With this strategy a business will produce a unique product or give a unique service.
- They may be similar products, but each will have some attributes which set it aside from the competition. Kotler suggested:
    - Performance
    - Style - TGI restaurants
    - Design
    - Consistency
    - Durability
    - Reliability
    - Reparability
- With a uiqueness the business can charge a premium price to its market segment.

## Skill shortages
- A skill shortage occurs when there are more vacancies than candidates. There are not enough staff with skills available to 
  fill all the vacancies.

## Skill shortages and their impact on international competitiveness
- The lack of ability to find skilled workers can cause a decline in competitive advantage.
- Those businesses that follow a differentiation strategy will suffer the most from skills shortages.
- UK cannot compete internationally if it doesn't have the talented staff to support operational objectives.
