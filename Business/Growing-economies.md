# 4.1.1 Growing economies:

## BRICS
BRICS - Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa
MINT - Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, Turkey

## Defenition: Economy
- An economy is the state of a country or region in terms of
  the production and consumption of goods and services 
  and the supply of money.
- Economy the large set of inter-related production and 
  consumption activities that help in deciding how scarce
  resources are allocated.

## Growth rate of the UK economy compared to emerging
## economies:
- The growth rate of a country is measured by the annual
  change in its gross domestic product (GDP).
- Emerging economies are economies that have increasing
  growth rates but relatively low income per head (per 
  capita).
- E.g. India, China and Brazil are considered to be emerging
  economies.

## UK growth tends to be lower than that of emerging countries
- A key factor in why emerging economies are growing at a 
  faster rate than the UK economy is because of the growth
  of their manufacturing sectors.
- The UK economy has seen a decline in its manufacturing 
  sector as businesses choose to manufacture in emerging
  economies due to lower labour costs and access to raw
  materials.
- China is the world's largest manufacturing economy and
  exporter of goods.

## Comparison of growth rates
- For this exam you will not be expected to be able to
  state the growth rate of any country but should understand 
  how the growth rate of emerging countries compares with the 
  UK.

UK = 1.5%
Brazil = 3.4%
Russia = 1.4%
India = 6.06%
China = 4.5%
South Africa = 0.5%

## Emerging economic power in the developing world
- Globalisation is the economic integration of different
  countries through increasing freedoms in the cross-border
  movement of people, goods/services, technology and
  finance.
- The past 20 years have been characterised by rapid 
  globalisation and the growing economic power of less 
  economically developed countries.
- The integration of global economies has impacted national
  cultures, spread ideas, and sped up industrialisation in
  developing nations.
- Emerging economic powers of countries within Asia, Africa
  and other parts of the world include BRICS and MINT.
- Emerging economies have a growing middle class with 
  increasing incomes, which allows their citizens to spend 
  more on domestic goods and imported goods from abroad.

## Economic growth
- Economic growth refers to the increase in GDP (value of 
  goods and services produced in an economy) over time.
  Growing econimies start to see changes in employment,
  patterns working women, migration, the rise of the multi-
  job, home working and the search for better-work-life-
  balance.

- The countries that manage to pull themselves out of poverty
  and get richer are those that are able to diversify away 
  from agriculture and other traditional goods.

- As labour and other resources move from arguculture into 
  modern economic activities, overall productivity rises and
  incomes expand.

## What does all this growth mean for business?
- All these new growing and emerging economies have increasing
incomes of their citizens.
- This means opportunities to incrase revenue and profit for 
  MNCs by moving into new markets.
- Increased incomes combined with low labour costs and 
  proximity to market make these growing economies very 
  attractive

## Trade opportunities
The growth of emerging economies creates a number of trading 
opportunities for international business. They include:
- Increased foreign direct inverstments (FDI),
- Opportunities for exporting to developing economies,
- Better infrastructure leading to developing economies 
  becoming a product location.

## Employment patterns
- As economies develop, unemployment rates tend to fall 
  significantly.
- This can also create opportunities for international trade 
  as increased incomes generate demand in an economy.
- So, as economies grow, so do the levels of skilled workers
  and the quality of education.
- This offers international business the opportunity to 
  recruit to skilled posts when producing abroad.

## Indicators of growth:
1. GDP per capita
2. Literacy
3. Health.
4. HDI

### GDP per capita
- Gross domestic product. Measures the output of goods and 
  services in an economy over a period of time.
- GDP per capita is calculated by taking the total output 
  (GDP) of a country and dividing it by the number of people 
  in that country.
- High GDP per capita is associated with a high standard of 
  living.
- It is important to look at GDP per capita over a period of
  time to see impovements or changes.

### Health
- A key indicator of the level of development and may include,
  life expectancy at birth, mortality, pollution exposure and
  clean access to water.
- The health of a country's citizens is important to 
  businesses that want to invest in emeriging economies, as
  this will have an impact on the quality og the workforce.
- Key indicators to consider are: average life expectancy,
  the infant mortality rate, access to healthcare and access
  to clean water.

### Literacy
- A key indicator of growth. Literacy refers to the 
  percentage of adults within an economy who can read and
  write.
  - Information about literacy rates is important, as this 
    will determine the quality of the workforce as well as 
    the customers businesses will be selling to.

### Human development index
- HDI is a composite index focusing on three basic measures
  of human development. Life expectancy at birth, mean 
  years of schooling and expected years of schooling and
  standard of living, measured by gross national income 
  per capita.
- The HDI combines the factors of life expectancy, 
  education, education and income to determine the quality
  of development of citizens within a country.
- Specifically, the HDI looks at the life expectancy, mean
  years of schooling and gross national income (GNI) per
  capita.
- The HDI was made by the united nations and is measured 
  between 0 and 1 (1 being the highest).
- The problem with using the HDI as a measure of develpoment
  is that:
  - It does not account for inequalities within a country,
  - There is a lack of reliable data in some countries.
