## 4.1.4 Protectionism:
- Protectionism is the theory or practice of shielding (or protecting) a country's domestic industries from foreign competition
  by taxing imports, imposing quotas or passing laws.
- Policies used by a government to protect domestic businesses by making foreign owned products less attractive. Examples include:
    - tarrifs
    - quotas
    - subsidies
    - regulation

# Reasons for protectionism
- It is human nature to want to protect what is ours.
- Protectionism is a goverments's actions to protect the businesses and interests of their own nation.
- Protectionism seeks to restrict imports into the country from companies in foreign nations.

# Protection for domestic industries
- The main reason that a government will seek to put in place protectionist policies is to protect their domestic industries.
- For example, the UK government will seek to protect the industries so may place tarrifs and quotas on imports of wine and 
  cheese.
- This stops the French markets from being flooded with cheap imports, which will affect the sales of local businesses.

# Tarrifs
- A tariff is a tax placed on an import to increase its price
  and decrease its demand.
- (A tax on imports to make them more expensive)
- Tariffs can be imposed by government to raise revenue and
  to restrict imports.
- A tariff is likely to raise the final price to the consumer,
  therefore a fall in demand for the goods.
- Consumers will switch consumption to domestic goods (see BBC
  article).

# Tarifs - Why they are imposed
1. To raise tax revenue - Poorer countries may impose heavy
   tariffs on imports to raise much needed funds for 
   healthcare and education.
2. For environmental reasons - Tariffs are sometimes only 
   placed on goods that have negative externalities e.g.
   cigarettes (sin tax).

# Benefits of tariffs
- Domestic produced goods do not incur the tariff and so are
  likely to be cheaper.
- Tariff protection allows domestic businesses to sell more 
  because they gain a price advantage compared to imports.
- It can ensure better job security.
- Tariffs can be reduced in strategic trade deals.

# Drawbacks of tariffs
- Some products, even with tariff costs added, do not put off
  potential customers willing to pay for unique or unusual
  imported products.
- Tariffs may just increase the cost to customers.
- Other countries may retaliate by imposing their own tariffs
  on imports.

# What is an import quota?
- A physical limit on the quantity of imports.
- Imposing a limit on the quantity of goods that are imported
  will increase the share of the market available for 
  domestic products.

# Why are quotas imposed?
- When an import quota is set, it allows a country to be sure
  of the amount of the good imported from the foreign country.
- When there is a tariff, if the supply curve of the foreign 
  country is unknown, the quantity of the good imported may
  not be predictable, quotas are predictable because the 
  actual amount is known.

# Benefits of import quotas
- Import quotas are imposed to:
    a. Protect jobs of domestic producers,
    b. Act as a bargaining chip to be used in negotiations on
       trade,
    c. Protect strategic industries such as defense and 
       agriculture.

# Drawbacks of quotas
- When one country uses quotas, its trading partners do the 
  same and the end result is fewer exporting opportunities for
  all producers and higher prices for all consumers.
- Quotas are also complex for the country using them. They 
  require a lot of paperwork indicating the same amounts of 
  products for each country facing a quota.
- It is also difficult to measure the precise degree of 
  protection quotas offer.

# Government legislation
- Sometimes a country will not be able to set tariffs or 
  quotas because of trade agreements or membership in a trade
  bloc, this means they need to come up with other ways of
  protecting their domestic industries from floods or cheap
  imports.
- They can do this through legislation e.g. No fakes, safety
  of toys etc.
