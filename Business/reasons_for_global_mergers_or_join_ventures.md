# 4.2.4 Reasons for global mergers or joint ventures

### Definition: Join venture
- A jount venture is a commerical enterprise undertaken 
  jointly by 2 or more parties which otherwise retain their
  distinct identities, this is only a temorary arrangement.
- In other words, two businesses come together to 
  collaborate on 1 project, but will still remain seperate 
  businesses.

### Definition: Merger
- A merger is where two businesses come together to become 
  one, on a permanent basis.

## 1. Spreading risk over countries/regions
- Businesses operating in different markets spreads the 
  risks associated with fluctuating economic conditions.
- If there is an economic downturn in one market, a 
  business may still gain sales in another market that
  is less affected.

## 2. Entering new markets/trading blocs
- Entering a market using a merger/joint venture is a 
  quicker method than organic growth.
- In emerging economies, many governments insist that 
  foreign businesses can only operate as joint ventures,
  as this can benefit domestic businesses.
- Forming a joint venture with a local company allows the
  joining business to gain knowledge of and establish
  business in the local markets.

## 3. Acquiring national/international brand names/patents
- A patent is the legal right given by the government to an 
  individual or business to make, use or sell an invention 
  and exclude others from doing so.
- The process of developing intellectual property can be a
  long and expensive process (Using a merger/acquisition is
  a method businesses can use to get access to  intellectual 
  property or get access to intellectual property or a 
  business with a strong reputation).

## 4. Securing resources/supplies
- Once businesses can strategically merge or create a joint
  venture with another business that has access to 
  resources (e.g. land and raw materials).
- This allows the business to quickly gain access to 
  resources, which helps to speed up the production process.
- Businesses have to be aware of any ethical issues 
  concerning the resource, as this can damage the reputation
  of the business.

## 5. Maintaining/increasing global competitiveness
- Businesses can increase their global dominance by merging
  or joining with another business.
- By expanding, a business can benefit from economies of 
  scale, which leads to lower costs.
- Businesses can reduce prices, which can increase sales, 
  leading to a larger market share.

### Benefits of joint ventures
- Access to knowleddge and resources such as capital, staff
  and technology.
- Access to new opportunities such as new markets or greater
  distribution reach.
- Sharing of scientists or professionals with unique skills.
- Economies of scale gained from costs spread over larger
  output can lead to increased profit margings.
- The diversification of risk due to having products in 
  several markets, so if there is a fall in sales of 
  certain products, the business can still generate revenue
  from other products.

### Drawbacks of joint ventures
- Around 50% of joint ventures fail because of the complexity
  of integrating operations and work culture of two different
  companies;
- An imbalance in power between the two organisations can 
  cause conflict.
- Potential loss in intellectual property (IP) such as patents.
- The initial costs of merging can be significantly high.
- There is no guarantee that a business will gain a return on
  its initial investment if it is not successfull.
- Diseconomies of scale can occur due to communication issues
  and a lack of control as the business expands.
- A culture cash between the two businesses can affect the 
  quality of the business, leading to poor sales.
- When two businesses join together, redundancies can occur.
  This can affect the motivation of remaining workers.
