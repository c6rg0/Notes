Critical path analysis:

CPA is a management tool which helps a business to identify how long a project will take and what the critial tasks in that project are.
The diagrams are called network diagrams, as they show a network of tasks in a project.

EST (earliest start time) - earliest possible moment that a task
can begin.
LFT (latest finish time) - the opposite of the above.
Float = LFT - Duration - EST from previous node 

Uses of CPA:
- To schedule a building project.
- To launch a new product onto the market,
- Organise a photo shoot of the new product. This would not happen on day one so a schedule would be usefull so bookings can be made,
- Plan the installation of new technology in a business (e.g. a new server),
- Plan the renovation of old buildings,
- Schedule and plan advertisement campaigns.

Benefits of using CPA:
- Stakeholders will be able to see the total time frame for the 
  project to be completed.
- Parallel activities can be scheduled.
- Very usefull for businesss in the FMGG (Fast Moving Consumer
  Goods) markets where speed is important.
- Usefull to know when to deliver resources or arrange for labour
  to arive.

Limitations of CPA:
- All the data in the network diagram are based on estimates and
  can quickly become inaccurate (e.g. if the weather turns bad on
  a building project or suppliers fail to turn up with a delivery).
- Drawring up a diagram and making all the calculations is time 
  consuming - it may be quicker to just get on with the project
  and tackle events as they arise.
- The project may be simple and not require a diagram.
