## 1.1
## Market share
- (business sales / total market sales) * 100
- The percentage of the total market sales that is earned 
  by one business.

Total market size = 60.1 = 22.3 + 14.6 + 2.9 + 2.5 + 1.1 + 16.7
(22.3 / 60.1) * 100 = 37.10% (2dp)


## Market growth
- (change / original) * 100
- It's written as a percentage

6.7 - 5.3 = 1.4 
(1.4 / 5.3) * 100 = 26.42% (2dp)

## 1.2
## Demand and supply


## 1.2 Price elasticity of demand
- (new - old) / old = % change
- % change in quantity demanded / % change in price = PED

- 5% / -16.66% = 0.299

- -0.7 x 3.5% = -2.45%

- -2.10% / 0.59% =  -3.56
- -4.47% / 1.47% =  -3.04
- -3.56 - -3.04 = -0.52

- (144 - 140) = 4 / 140 = 0.0286
- (27195 - 27000) / 27000 = 0.00722

## 1.3 Mark up pricing
- (profit per item / cost per item) x 100

- (6.35 / 3.64) x 100 = 174.45% (2dp)

## 2.1 Cash flow and cash flow forecasting
- Net cash flow = cash inflows - cash outflows
- Opening balance = the previous month's closing balance 
- Closing balance = opening balance + net cash flow

- January: 8100 - 7800 = 300
- Febuary: 11300 - 9600 = 1700

## 2.2 Sales, revenue and costs
- Sales revenue = selling price x quantity sold
- Total costs = fixed costs + (variable costs per unit x quantity sold)

- 2.50 x 7000 = 17500
- 2,600 + (1 x 7000) = 9600
- Profits: 17500 - 9600 = £7900

## 2.2 Break even
- Contribution per unit = selling price - variable cost per unit
- Break even output = fixed costs / contribution per unit
- Margin safety = actual sales - break even output

- 2600 / (2.50 - 1 = 1.5) = 1733.33

- (3,000,000 / (5 - 2)) - 1,500,000 = 500,000

- 84 - 34 = 50 
- 30,000 / 12 = 2500 sales to break even 
- 2500 / 50 = 50 sales to break even each month 

- £10,000 / 1,000 = £10
- 50,000 - 40,000 = 10,000 / 5,000 = £2
- 10 - 2 = £8

## 2.2 Budgets
- Budget variance = actual - budget
- The difference between the actual figure and the budgeted (target) figure.

## 2.5 Profitability ratios (ratio analysis)
- Gross profit margin = (gross market / revenue) x 100
- The % of revenue earned as gross profit 

- Operating profit marging = (operating profit / revenue) x 100
- The % of revenue earned as operating profit

- Net profit margin = (net profit / revenue) x 100
- The % of revenue earned as net profit

- 540 - 175 = 365 gross
- 365 - 220 = 145 operating
- 145 - 45 = 100 net

## 2.5 Ratio analysis (financial efficiency)
- Current ratio = current assets / current liabilities
- How many £ of current assets a business has for every £ of current liabilities.

- Acid test ratio = (current assets - inventories)  / current liabilities
- How many £ of highly liquid current assets a business has for every £ of current liabilities.

- 185 / 97 = 1.91 : 1
- (185 - 96) / 97 = 0.92 : 1

- (2022) 1,144,702 / 345,824 = 3.31 : 1 
- (2021) 1,032,463 / 417,974 = 2.47 : 1 

- Jonathan Trumbulls liquidity position has gotten better

## 2.4 Productivity / Efficiency
- Meaning: How much is spend on labour costs for each unit 
  produced.
- Labour cost per unit = total labor costs / output

- (400 x 2000) / 20,000 = 800,000 / 20,000 = £40


## 2.4 Capacity utilisation
- Meaning: What percentage of the maximum possible capacity
  is being used by the business.
- Capacity utilisation = (actual output / max output) x 100

- (320,000 / 400,000) x 100 = 80%

## 3.3 3 point moving averages


## 3.3 4 point moving averages


## 3.3 Investment appraisal (payback period)
- Meaning: How long it takes to recover the initial investment
  cost.
- CCF: Cumulative cash flow.
- Calculation: First positive CCF denotes payback;
  (amount remaining to pay back * 12) / following year's cash
  flow
