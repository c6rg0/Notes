# Global marketing strategy
- There are two approaches to international marketing, one strategy is to adapt to local cultures (glocalisation) and the
  alternative is to standardise the product so it is the same around the world (global marketing).

- A global marketing strategy means that a business does not differentiate its products or marketing between countries. 
  The same product is sold in many countries with only some fine tuning of the product, price or promotion etc.

## Global marketing: brands
- A MNC that follows a global marketing strategy views the world as one marketplace and creates product that will suit a
  world audience.
- A good example is Microsoft Office, the product is the same all over the world there are no changes for local culture.

## Benefits and drawbacks of global marketing:
- Benefits:
    - Economies of scale can be achieved in both production and distribution. This will mean lower than average marketing 
      costs.
    - Power in the market as the brand is known.
    - Consistency in brand image.
    - Ability to leverage good ideas quickly and efficiently.
    - Uniformity of marketing practices.
- Drawbacks:
    - Differences in consumer needs, wants and usage patterns for products.
    - Differences in consumer response to marketing mix elements.
    - Differences in brand and product developmentan the competetive environment.
    - Differences in the legal environment some of which may conflict with those of the market.

# Glocalization
- In the 1980's Roland Robertson wrote an article in the Harvard Business Review and coined the term 'Glocalisation'.
- It is a combination of the words 'globalisation' and 'localisation' and is used to describe products and services distributed
  globaly but adapted so they suit the needs of local markets.

## Glocalisation and the local market
- MNCs wanting to successfully complete in different countries will need to provide a level of local customisation to meet
  cultural preferences.
- Cultural freindly media and advertising campaigns might be used to encourage acceptance of foreign products in global markets.

## Benefits and drawbacks of glocalisation:
- Benefits:
    - MNCs get access to larger culturally different markets,
    - MNCs that follow a glocalisation strategy can compete more efficiently in those markets,
    - More demand from customers familiar with those products e.g. customers in India might prefer dark chocolate.
- Drawbacks:
    - Small local business will struggle to compete with the MNCs as they can't get the economies of scale of production,
    - Expensive, slow and complex to launch new products that have to be adapted to the local markets.

### Polycentric
- The international approach is the polycentric models - adapting the marketing mix to maximise sales in different
  countries, features:
    - a) Each host country is unique,
    - b) Each subsidary business in each country should have its own marketing approach,
    - c) Products in each host country may vary to take account of local costs.

- MNCs that follow a polycentric marketing strategy put effort into the development and marketing of products that will
  suit the locals in different markets.
- Benefits are higher sales due to getting the product right for that marketplace.
- Drawbaks are the high research and development costs for adaptation.

### Ethnocentric
- When a MNC has an ethocentric marketing approach, this means that they may little or no attempt to adapt the products for
  the local markets in which they trade.
- The benefits of this are economies of scale and lower development costs.
- The drawbacks are that sales may be lower as the products are not adapted to suit different markets.

### Geocentric
- When a MNC has a geocentric marketing strategy they will promote the global brand name but still tailor products to meet local
  markets where needed.
- In this way it is a mixture of the ethnocentric and polycentric approacheds.
- Benefits are that this strategy can attract higher sales.
- Drawbacks are the higher product development costs that other strategies.

Product, Price, Promotion, Place

## Product
- Products that are known globally, like Coca-Cola are easier to sell in new international markets.
- As people travel the world, they can be assured that wherever they go the product that they buy from the business will be 
  same.

- Despite its status, as a global icon, Coca-Cola understands that it has to find a way to speak to consumers at a more 
  personal local level.
- The 'Share a Coke' campaign has now successfully expanded to over 50 countries. Each country's coke products are customised to
  its local culture and language which the most popular first names of each region printed out on the cans and bottles in place
  of the company's logo.

## Place
- Distribution in national markets such at the UK will probably involve goods being moved in a chain from the manufacturer to
  wholesalers and onto retailers for consumers to buy from.

- In an overseas market, there will be more parties involved because the goods need to be moved around a foreign market where a
  business practices will be different to national markets.
- For example, agents might be used to sell products in other countries.

## Price
- Setting international prices is very complex.
- It is unliely that a MNC will attempt to gain the same price in Mexico or Brazil as it does in Germany or France due to the
  disposable income of the population.

- Business needs to consider factors such as:
    - The cost of transport tarrifs or,
    - Import duties,
    - Exchange rate fluctuations,
    - Personal disposable incomes of the target market,
    - The currency they want to be paid in,
    - The general economic situation of the country and how this will influence pricing.

## Promotion
- Standardised marketing can be used internationally.
- This type of marketing strategy conforms to work across different cultures and countries to promote a product.
- This reduced costs and ensures the brand is known worldwide.

- Advertising messages in countries may have to be adapted because of language, political climate, cultural attitudes and
  religious practices.
- For example, a business cannot promote white bridal wear in India as it is worn as a colour by mourners.
