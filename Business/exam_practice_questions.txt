Using the data in Extracts (E to H), Payback and NPV investment
appraisal methods, evaluate Plan A and B expansion plans and 
recommend which one might be better for Northfield Cycles:

Plan:
Payback:
  Pros:
    It is a simple method to calculate and understand
    It is useful when new products are made regularly
  Cons:
    It provides no insight into the profitability

NPV:
  Pros:
    It considers the opportunity cost of money
    Businesses may choose different discount tables to adjust 
    the levels of risk involved
  Cons:
    Challenging to accurately forecast future cash flows

Payback is a method of investment appraisal which works out the
time is takes to pay back the initial investment. NPV (net present
value) is a method of investment appraisal that takes interest 
rates into account by calculating the present value, discounted
according to the interest given up.

One reason why payback may be recomended for Northfield Cycles (NC)
is because it is a simple method to calculate and understand.
This means that Richard Tranter - the owner - can calculate payback
himself, saving money that might have been more productively spent
doing normal shop duties (selling, servicing, fixing). Also 
considering that he sells an average of £40,000 worth of bikes a
week, it's safe to consider that he doesn't have much time to
use more complicated investment appraisal methods.

Another reason why Northfield Cycles should use payback is because
Giant bikes, and possibly other brands can have a product life 
span as short as 12 months, and that new products are regulary 
made.
