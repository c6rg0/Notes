# 4.4.1
# The impact of MNCs

- A MNC is a multinational corporation, a business which 
  operates in more than one country. For example, coca-cola
  produces in over 200 countries.

# Impact of MNCs on the local economy

## Positive impacts
- Creates employment: There are jobs available for local 
  people, so reducing th numbers of unemployed.
- Increases skills base: Many MNCs operate training schemes
  for local people to learn how to use machinery. Such skills
  also attract other firms to the country.
- Increased standard of living: An increase in earnings 
  increase taxes paid within the country and gives the 
  government more money to spend on services.
- Raises the country's profile: MNCs plan their moves 
  carefully. This is known worldwide and the movement into a 
  particular country is a statement about its pro-business
  environment and political stability.
- Improves balance of payments: Many goods made by MNCs are 
  exported to other nearby countries. This increases the 
  amount of money earned by the country.
- Improves infrastructure: MNCs often improve communication
  links within a country, e.g road, rail and port facilities 
  are updated and expanded. This benefits the country.

## Negative impacts
- Profit leakage: Profits from factories or hotels run by 
  the MNC go to the home country of the MNC e.g USA.
- Low paid jobs: Mainly low paid jobs are provided for local
  people. Higher paid managerial jobs go to workers brought
  in from the head office country.
- Pull out quickly: MNCs may leave a country overnight if 
  profits fall, leaving the locals without jobs.
- Poor safety record: Developing nations often have lower 
  safety standards, and governments are willing to turn a 
  blind eye to MNCs breaking the laws.
- Increases urbanisation: Most jobs created by MNCs are 
  usually found in or close to urban areas. The hope of 
  securing these jobs attracts more people from rural areas
  to cities causing overcrowding.
- Widens poverty gap: Although wages are low in factories, 
  they are higher than elsewhere. This increases the cost of
  living for all, as prices of goods rise.

## Local labour
- The positive impacts are that the MNC provides jobs for the
  locals and that will give them an increased income to spend
  in local shops, increasing local demand for goods and
  services and increasing jobs.
- Negative impacts are that there may be exploitation of this
  labour with low wages and poor working conditions e.g no
  safety equipment.

## Wages
- Two arguments for the impact of MNCs on wages of employees 
  in host nations.
- The first is that MNCs tend to pay higher than local 
  businesses, making it hard for these local enterprises to
  attract good staff as they are unable to compete with the 
  wages.
- The second is that in the long-term, these wages rises and 
  can lead to an improvement in the economy of the host
  nation.

## Job creation
- Some jobs are created by the governments e.g council jobs,
  999 and public serives jobs, but this still leaves a nation
  that needs employment.
- MNCs moving into developing nations are an excellent 
  source of employment. Some create 1000s of jobs in the 
  nations they move into.

## Local businesses
- Positive impact: As the local population gain employment,
  their income rises and they can spend their wages at
  local businesses e.g shops.
- Negative impact: MNCs in some industries (e.g fast food)
  move into an area and the local businesses cannot compete
  with the low prices and range of products.

## The local community
- The Unocal Corporation, which recently became a subsidary
  of Chevron, is an oil and gas company based in California
  with operations around the world.
- In December 2004, the company settled a lawsuit filled by
  15 Burmese villagers, in which the villagers alleged 
  Unocal's complicity in a range of human rights violation in
  Burma, including execution, torture, forced labour and 
  forced migration.

## The environment
- In India, Coca-Cola extracted 1.5 million litres of deep 
  well water, which they bottled and sold under the names
  Dasani and BonAqua.
- The groundwater was severely depleted, affecting thousands
  of communities with water shortages and destroying
  agricultural activity.
- As a result, the remaining water became contaminated with
  high chloride and bacteria levels, leading to scabs, eye
  problems, and stomache aches in the local population.
