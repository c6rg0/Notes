-2.10 / 0.59 = -3.56
-4.47 / 1.47 = -3.04

-3.56 - -3.04 = -0.52

Income elasticity of deman measures responsiveness of quantity
demanded to a change in consumer income:
  - YED = % change in qd / % change in income
 
- Normal goods - Consumer products that experience an increase
  demand due to an increase in income.
  - Necessities - Basic goods that consumers need to buy.
  - Luxuries - Goods that consumers like to buy if they can 
    afford them
- Inferior goods - When income increase there is a decease
  in quantity demanded.

- A YED value can be negative or positive.
- A good with a positive YED value is considered as a normal
  good. If demand changes little with a change in income, it's
  a necessity (YED 0-1). If demand changes a lot more with 
  income, it's a luxury good (YED > 1).
- A good with a negative YED value is considered an inferior
  good.

# Factors that affect YED:
- Nature of the good
- The price of a product relative to incomes can also 
  influence income elasticity. Demand for products that are

# Importance of YED
1. Forecasting demand:
  - YED allows businessses to predict how sales will change
    if incomes rise or fall.
  - Example: if a luxury car has YED = 2, a 10% increase in
    consumer income -> expected 20% income in demand.

2. Pricing and product strategy:
  - Helps in describing which products to focus on during
    different economic conditions.
  - Example: Necessities (inelastic YED) can maintain stable
    prices during recessions; luxury goods (elastic YED) may
    need promotions when incomes are low.

3. Production and inventory planning
  - Business can adjust production levels according to 
    expected changes in income-driven demand.
  - Example: Manufacturers of high-end electronics may 
    increase production in booming economies.

4. Market expansion and tarketing
  - YED helps identify high-growth markets where incomes are
    rising, allowing businesses to target the right segments.
  - Example: Expanding luxury brand stores in emerging 
    economies with rising incomes.


(2,300,300 - 2000000) / 2000000 = Change in demand
Change in demand = 0.15
Change in income = 2%
YED = (% change in demand / % change in income)

1.5 / 2 = 0.75
