# 4.2.1 Conditions that prompt trade

- Push factors are conditions that force businesses to look
  outside their domestic markets for new opportunities.
- They often arise from pressures within the home market
  that make international trade an attractive option. 
  Examples include saturated markets, competition, and the
  need to extend the product life cycle.

- Conditions in the home country that encourage firms to 
  expand overseas.

- The two PUSH factors that Edexcel would like you to know 
  about are:
    - Saturated markets with only low growth opportunities,
    - High level at domestic completion.


## 1. Saturated markets
- A saturated domestic market means that a business or group
  of businesses has sold a product to just about everyone
  who will buy one.
- While research and development (R&D) is still taking place
  the business needs to continue trade and to grow and so 
  will look for new markets for the products abroad.

## 2. Competition in the domestic market
- High levels of competition in the domestic market means 
  that a business will look abroad to where there may be less
  competition and lucrative market opportunities to trade.
- An exmple is the food and drink market in the UK, it is 
  very competetive but there is a very bouyant market for 
  unusual food exported to other countries.
- The UK exports £22 billion a year in food and drink, 
  demonstrating a desire for British taste around the world.


- A domestic market is the home market. If the business is a
  UK business, then the domestic market is the UK. Every 
  other market would ben an 'international' market.


# Pull factors
- These are conditions that attract businesses to foreign 
  markets, often offering specific advantages that make 
  global trade an appealing opporunity.

- Pull factors are conditions in a foreign country that 
  attract firms to trade of invest there.

- The two pull factors that Edexcel would like you to know
  about are:
    - Economies of scale
    - Risk spreading

## Pull factors means opportunities in oversea markets
- Exporting is one way for a business to increase sales and
  this can contribute to increased profits.
- An export opportunity may arise when demand increases for
  the product in other countries.
- A business selling in overseas markets will be able to 
  grow faster than those limited to domestic markets.

## 1. Ability to gain economies of scale
- Exporting is an excellent way to drive production to a 
  level that delivers economies of scale, particularly if
  the product or service is standard across export markets
  with little to no need for adaptation.
- Achieving greater economies of scale will allow the 
  business to became more cost-competetive.

# Types of economies of scale
- Marketiong economies of scale: A business can spread the
  cost of one advertising campaign across several countries
  or products.
- Bulk buying: A business can reduce the cost of raw 
  materials by getting discounts from suppliers for buying
  goods in bulk quantities.
- Technical economies of scale: A business can spread the
  high fixed cost of buying large equipment over the 
  production of more goods.
- Financial economies of scale: As a business grows they 
  will be able to negotiate better lending rates with banks,
  reduces fixed costs.
- Risk bearing: The larger the company becomes the more 
  likely it is to survive a downturn in the economy.

## 2. Ability to spread risk
- The ability to spread risk becomes a pull factor when a
  foreign market offers firms the opportunity to reduce their
  overall business risk.
- A key benefit of exporting to other nations is that it 
  allows the business to spread the risk.
- By selling in other countries the business is less
  vulnurable to changes in the domestic economy.
- Different countries may have different growth rates at any
  price at any time, setting it.

## What's the difference between offshoring and outsourcing?
- Offshoring is when a business relocates some of its 
  business process to another country. This is usually 
  manufacturing, or a supporting process such as accounting.

### Benefits of offshoring
- Offshoring can offer companies a range of benefits and 
  prompt trade, these include:
    - To take advantage of lower minimum wage levels in 
      other countries
    - To take advantage of trade blocs or trade deal
    - To take advantage of tax and other benefits offered
      by the host nation
    - Access to a larger talent pool

### Limitations of offshoring
- Loss of control
- Communication difficulties
- Quality issues
- Reputational damage
- Political and economic risk
- Hidden costs

# Outsourcing
- Outsourcing is where a business function, such as payroll,
  is contracted out to third-party businesses.
- These may, or may not, be in another country.

## Outsourcing examples
- Marketing research
- Accounting
- Legal services
- Call centres
- Office cleaning
- Website development

## Benefits include
- Flexibility
- Lower cost
- Get exprerts
- Allow business to focus on core

# 1. Outsourcing - production
- This means sending some (or all) of the production to 
  other companies to complete.
- Some motor manufacturers now outsource not only parts but
  complete assemblies - steering, transmissions, engines, and
  interior assemblies.
- 1/5 of Europe's cars are sub-assembled in Eastern Europe.

# 2. Outsourcing - payroll
- The completion of paperwork and stuff.

# 3. Outsourcing - purchasing
- Purchasing and maintaining information systems.

# 4. Outsourcing - delivery
- Larger companies might prefer to contact a major delivery 
  firm to do their delivery for them.

# Product lifecycle extension
- The product lifecycle extension stategy is where a mature 
  or even declining product could be sold into international 
  markets. This means that the company, rather than 
  withdrawing the product from sales and can continue to make 
  and distribute it.

- Cost savings for example in:
    - Product design
    - Package design
    - Logistics


# Extension of product lifecycle
- Extending the product lifecycle by selling in multiple 
  markets.
- This means being able to sell a product that might be in
  decline in the UK into a new international market as a new
  product.
- Developign nations often see our 'mature' or 'declining'
  products as new and existing.
