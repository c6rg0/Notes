1. Strategic fit:
	- A company jmay aquire another company to expand into new markets, diversify its product offerings 
	  or gain access to new technology.

2. Econimies of scale:
	- Growth creates economies of scale (consolidation of two or more businesses typically reduces 
	  costs and increases efficiency)

3. Synergies:
- Synergies are the benefitis that result from the combination of two or more companies, such as increased revenue, cost savings or improved product range.

Vertical Integration:

- Vertical integration is when one business in one sector
  takes over or mergers with a business in another sector
  or part of the supply chain.

		  backwards in the supply chain.
		- E.g. an ice cream retailer takes over an ice cream
		  manufacturer.
	
	Advantages:
		- Reduces the cost of production as middleman profits are eliminated.
		- Lower costs make the firm more competetive.
		- Greater control over the supply chain reduce risk as access to raw materials is more certain.
		- The quality of raw materials can be controlled.
		- Forward integration adds additional profit, as profits from the next stage of production are assimilated.
		- Forward integration can increase branch visibility.

	Disadvantages:
		- Disseconomies of scale occur as costs increase.
		- There can be a culture clash between the two firms that have merged.
		- Possibly, a lack of expertise in running the new firm results in inefficiencies.

Horizontal:

  another business in the same factor.
- A merger or takover of a firm at the same stage of the 
  production process.

	Advantages:

		- Reductions in the cost per unit due to economies of scale
		- Reduces competition
		- Existing knowledge of the industry means the merger is 
		  more likely to be successfull
		- The firm may gain new knowledge or expertise

	Disadvantages:
		- Disseconomies of scale may occur as costs increase (e.g
		  Unnecessary duplication of production facilities)
		- If the integration leads to a reduction of competition,
		  regulators may investigate the merger or block it.


Financial risk of mergers and takeovers:
- Original purchase cost
- Cost of change into a new business
- Redundancies of duplicate staff
- Cost if it all goes wrong

Problems of rapid growth:
- The business may have merged may outgrow their premises in the short-term. There may not be enough 
  space for everyone to work efficiently.
- Morale may drop if staff cannot cope with the extra work so productivity can decrease.
- There amy be a shortage of cash to meet expansion costs.
- Taking on more work to generate more income places additional pressure on the premises and staff.
- Management may be under pressire operating reactively rather than proactively.

- The quality of the products and services could drop causing an increase in customer complaints.
- The business may even lose customer to their competitors.
- Staff turnover may increase due to heavy workloads. Vital knowledge could be lost as staff leave hiring 
  and training new staff takes takes time and money.

- Clash of cultures
- Possible communication problems
- Possible move away from core competencies of original business may cause issues of control.
- Unreliable merger partners
- Diseconomies of scale
- Lack of understanding of local markets leading to wrong promotial message
- 75% of all merfers fall

Diseconomies of scale:
Diseconomies of scale occur when a business's average cost per unit of output increases as its size or production volume grows.
This increase in per unit costs is caused by internaf inefficiencies such as communication breakdowns, coordination problems, 
and declining worker motivation in larger, more complex organization.


Organic growth:
Organic growth is the process of business growth which comes from internally within the business.
This is the opposite of mergers and takeovers where growth comes from sources external to the business.

Organic growth means that the business has grown internally.
