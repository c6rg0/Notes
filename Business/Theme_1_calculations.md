## 1.1
## Market share
- (business sales / total market sales) * 100
- The percentage of the total market sales that is earned 
  by one business.

Total market size = 60.1 = 22.3 + 14.6 + 2.9 + 2.5 + 1.1 + 16.7
(22.3 / 60.1) * 100 = 37.10% (2dp)


## Market growth
- (change / original) * 100
- It's written as a percentage

6.7 - 5.3 = 1.4 
(1.4 / 5.3) * 100 = 26.42% (2dp)

  their market.


## 1.2
## Demand and supply


## 1.2 Price elasticity of demand
- (new - old) / old = % change
- % change in quantity demanded / % change in price = PED

- 5% / -16.66% = 0.299

- -0.7 x 3.5% = -2.45%

- -2.10% / 0.59% =  -3.56
- -4.47% / 1.47% =  -3.04
- -3.56 - -3.04 = -0.52

- (144 - 140) = 4 / 140 = 0.0286
- (27195 - 27000) / 27000 = 0.00722

## 1.3 Mark up pricing
- (profit per item / cost per item) x 100

- (6.35 / 3.64) x 100 = 174.45% (2dp)

## 2.1 Cash flow and cash flow forecasting
- Net cash flow = cash inflows - cash outflows
- Opening balance = the previous month's closing balance 
- Closing balance = opening balance + net cash flow

- January: 8100 - 7800 = 300
- Febuary: 11300 - 9600 = 1700

## 2.2 Sales, revenue and costs
- Sales revenue = selling price x quantity sold
- Total costs = fixed costs + (variable costs per unit x quantity sold)

- 2.50 x 7000 = 17500
- 2,600 + (1 x 7000) = 9600
- Profits: 17500 - 9600 = £7900

## 2.2 Break even
- Contribution per unit = selling price - variable cost per unit
- Break even output = fixed costs / contribution per unit
- Margin safety = actual sales - break even output

- 2600 / (2.50 - 1 = 1.5) = 1733.33

- (3,000,000 / (5 - 2)) - 1,500,000 = 500,000
