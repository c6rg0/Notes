3.3.2 Investment appraisal:

Defenition: Investment appraisal:
  Investment appraisal attempts to determine the value of capital
  expenditure projects.
  It enables the business and its investors to compare projects so
  that the business can expand and meet their objectives - usually
  profit maximisation and efficiency.

[The evaluation of an investment project to determine whether 
or not it is likely to  be worthwhile.]

Investment appraisal - planning process:
  Investment appraisal is the planning process used to determine
  whether the long-term investments will give the best return.
  Typical project that may be assessed include:
  - Purchasing new machinery
  - Acquiring new premises
  - Research and development projects

Investment appraisal - decision making:
  A business will have lots of ideas for projects, and proposals of
  ways to grow their business.
  The business will only have a finite amount of money and so 
  perhaps only one project will get the funding it needs to go 
  ahead. Investment appraisal is used to work out whicch project
  should get the funds.

3 methods for investment appraisal:
  Payback
  ARR
  NPV

1. Simple payback:
  Simple payback is a financial metric used by individuals and 
  businesses to evaluate investments.
  It is a straightforward tool for quickly assessing the lenght 
  of time it takes to recover an intitial financial outlay.
  This method indicates how rapidly an investment generates 
  sufficient cash flow to cover its original cost.

  cost of investment / total cash inflow

  A business needs to decide which project or proposal to invest
  funds in.
  It cannot afford all four so it will have a number of methods to
  work out which one it should spend the money on.
  The table starts at year 0 because this is the amount invested
  in the project at the start.

Alternate methods:
-----------------------------------------------------------------
				-   Project A	-   Project B   -
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Purchase price			- £225M		- £450		-
Average yearly net cash flow	- £45M		- £75		-
Simple payback			- 5 years	- 6 years	-
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Interpretation-payback period:
  In payback period calculations, the aim is to determine how quickly an investment can recover its initial outlay.
  A shorter payback period is generally preffered because it means the project returns the invested funds sooner.
  Once recovered, these funds can be reinvested into other opportunities, increasing the overall efficiency and 
  flexibility of capital use. This is particulalrly valuable in environments where liquidity is limited or where 
  multiple investment options compete for funding.


Advantages of payback method:
- It is a simple method to calculate and understand.
- It is particularly useful for business where cash flow management is vital.
- Businesses can identift the point at which an investment is paid back and is contributing positively to cash flow.
- It is also useful when new technology is introduced regularly.
- Businesses purchasing equipment can calculate whether an investment "pays back" before an upgrade is available.

Disadvantages:
- It provides no insight into the profitability of investments.
- Payback only considers the total length of time to recover an investment.
- Neither is the timing nor the future value of cash inflows is considered.
- It may encourage a short-termism approach.
- Potentially lucrative investments may be dismissed, as they take longer to pay back than alternatives.


ARR:
  Accounting rate of return.
  Payback is a very simplistic tool and only looks at when the project will pay back but does not consider rate of return.
  So, a business can also use the ARR system which looks at tge average rate of return of the projects.
  Businesses often compare ARR results a "hurdle rate" or benchmarks (e.g. the return from a 5% savings account, or a firm's 
  cost of the capital.

  AAR is a  method of investment appraisal that measures the net return per annum as a percentage of the intitial spending.

  ARR = (Average anual profit / initial investment) x 100
  The outcome of the formula is expressed as a percentage, which makes it easy to compare investment options.

  Steps to follow for ARR calculation:
    Step 1: Calculate the total profit over the lifetime of the investment
    Step 2: Divide the total profit by the number of years of the investment project to find the average annual profit
    Step 3: Divide the average annual profit by the initial outlay
    Step 4: Multiply the outcome by 100 to find the percentage

Pros of ARR:
- Simple to calculate and easy to understand
- Quick comparison of investment options
- Long-term performance evaluation 
- Useful in decision making

Cons of ARR:
- Ignores the time value of money
- Limited to one metric
- Reliance on estimates

Interpretation - ARR:
- We compare ARR to a benchmark;
  e.g This could be the interest rate on savings, the firm's cost of capital, or a target return set by management.
- If the ARR is higher than the benchmark, this project is financially attractive.
- If the ARR is lower than the benchmark, the project may not be worth pursuing.

NPV:
  Net present value, a method of investment appraisal that takes interest rates into account by caluclating the present value, 
  discounted according to the interest foregone (given up).

  Once a business has looked at the payback period for a set of projects and then looked at the ARR they may need to look at the NPV.
  This is the net present value, and it considers that money in the future is not worth what it is today - so it adds in a discount
  table to make it more realistic.

-95
10 x 0.83 = 8.3
40 x 0.69 = 27.6
40 x 0.58 = 23.2
60 x 0.48 = 28.8
50 x 0.40 = 20

-95 + 8.3 + 27.6 + 23.2 + 28.8 + 20 = 12.9

-80
30 x 0.83 = 24.9
40 x 0.69 = 27.6 
30 x 0.58 = 17.4 
30 x 0.48 = 14.4
20 x 0.40 = 8
-80 + 24.9 + 27.6 + 17.4 + 14.4 + 8 = 12.3 

-160
30 x 0.83 = 24.9 
50 x 0.69 = 34.5
90 x 0.58 = 52.2
80 x 0.48 = 38.4
60 x 0.40 = 24
-160 + 24.9 + 34.5 + 52.2 + 38.4 + 24 = 14 

  Interpretation NPV:
    In NPV calculations, the goal is to identify the highest investment options that yields the highest future value of funds.
    A positive NPV indicates that the investment is expected to generate more value than its cost, making it financially viable.
    Conversely, a negative NPV suggests that the investment would result in a net loss and is therefore not advisable.

  Advantages of NPV method:
    It considers the opportunity cost of money,
    Discount tables are used to calucalate the forecasted future values of net cash flows,
    Businesses mey choose different discount tables (20%, 10%, 50% etc.) to ajust the level of risk involved in a project, allowing
    a range of scenarios to be considered.

  Disadvantages of NPV:
    It is more complicated to calculate and interpret that other methods of investment appraisal.
    One of the primary challanges of using the NPV method is accurately forecasting future cash flows.
    Selecting an appropriate discount rate can be challenging, and even small changes in the discount rate can significantly impact
    the calculated NPV.
    The NPV method only considers the financial costs and benefits of a project and does not account for non-financial benefits or costs,
    e.g. environmental damage.


Limitations of Investment appraisal:
  Each of the investment appraisal techniques relies upon forecasted future cash flows, which may lack accuracy.
  Long term cash flow forecasts can be inaccurate for several reasons: Unexpected increases in costs, the arrival of new competitors, 
  changes in consumer tastes, uncertainties dues to economic growth or recession.
  Factor other than the cost of investment and the return on investment are not considered.
