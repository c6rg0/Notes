Quantative sales forecasting:

Quantative sales forcasting is a statistical technique which uses user data to make predictions about the possible sales level in the
future.
This method that your exam board would like you to know about is called - time series analysis.
In a nutshell, it uses historical data, smoothed out to make better sales predictions for the future, so that production or purchasing of 
supplies can be more accurate, thus reducing costs.

Once a business has carried out time series analysis, they will use this information to;
  Organise production
  Organise the staff needed for this level of production (hr)
  Organise the finances to manufacture the products
  Organise marketing to promote the products being sold

3 period moving average calculations:
  The business production operations manager might need to look at the sales data 3 times a year and smooth out any seasonal variations or
  spikes in the data.
  This will help the business to organise all the functions that are involved in producing the goods or services; marketing, finance,
  production and human resources.

Line of best fit:
  Having identified the trend line using the time series analysis, future sales can be predicted by drawing a line of best fit and 
  extrapolating it to a point in the future.
  A line of best fit can be drawn by eye or plotted accurately using a computer or graph paper. The line of best fit should pass through 
  (x,y) where x is the average of years, and y is average sales.

300 + 500 + 600 + 550 = 1950
500 + 600 + 550 + 600 = 2250
600 + 550 + 600 + 750 = 2500
550 + 600 + 750 + 850 = 2750
600 + 750 + 850 + 1100 = 3200
750 + 850 + 1100 + 800 = 3500
850 + 1100 + 800 + 1100 = 3850

1950 + 2250 = 4200 / 8 = 525
2250 + 2500 = 4750 / 8 = 593.75
2500 + 2750 = 5250 / 8 = 656.25
2750 + 3300 = 6050 / 8 = 756.25
3300 + 3500 = 6800 / 8 = 850
3500 + 3850 = 7350 / 8 = 918.75 

Interpreting scatter graphs:
Scatter graphs allow businesses to compare two variables, such as sales volume and advertising, to establish if there is any correlation
between them.

Types of correlation:
A correlation exists where there is a relationship or connection between two things.

A positive correlation means that as one variable increases, so 
does the other variable (A line of best fit that slopes upwards 
can be identified).

A negative correlatio neans that as one variable increases, the
other variable decreases (A line of best fit that slopes downwards
can be identified).

Correlation does not always indicate causation or relationship
between two sets of variables, so businesses need to conduct
research to establish whether a relationship exists, as well as
the strength of that relationship.

Limitations of quantative sales forecasting techniques:
- Past sales figures are no guarantee of future sales.
- Businesses need to appreciate the SWOT and PESTLE factors that 
  may affect future predictions (for example; weather, trends,
  competitor activity, terrorist activity).
- Quantative sales forecasting relies on what has happened in the
  past continuing to happen, and historical data is not always
  a good indicator of what might happen in the future (COVID).
- In high technology markets change happens rapidly and have a 
  short product life cycle.
- It is time consuming and complex, only as reliable as the data.
- Use of moving averages doesn't consider how recent the data is.
