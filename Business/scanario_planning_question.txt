## Question:
## Assess the usefulness of scenario planning to a business
## such as ASOS (12 marks).

Scenario planning is planning for the future to try to prevent
possible issues that could occur without warning. Through 
risk assesment, a business might identify one of the 
following problems: natural disasters, loss of key staff and 
IT service failure.

One advantage of scenario planning to a business such as ASOS
is that it could help the business mitigate problems as they
occur. There are four steps to risk mitigation: risk 
acceptance, risk avoidance, risk limitation and risk 
transference. These all are supposed to be used in a state
of certainty without any problems going on, but risk 
acceptance and limitation would ensure that the company can
still carry on in a situation opposite to ideal. This
could have been a reason behind the success of the companies
recovery from the 2014 Barnsley site fire, which disrupted 
the business for three days.

Another stength of scenario planning is that through scenario
planning, the business can prepare for future problems. ASOS
has gone through 2 fires (in 2017 and 2014), and despite the 
damage of 2 million products for £6 million, with the help
of their scenario plan: they were able to contain the fire, 
follow all the relevant safety measures, and successfully 
fulfil orders from Germany through its Barnsley warehouse.
Compared to the 2014 Barnsley site fire, where the company 
lost 20% of their total stock, they were able to reduce the 
impact a significant amount so that the business doesn't get
close to failing.

However, you could argue that scenario planning isn't as 
useful because it requires a significant resource investment.
To ensure that all the systems that keep the business running 
have plans and backups, as well as more widespread 
infrastructure to spread risks to make sure there isn't 
just a singular point of failure will be expensive. 
For example, if a database which holds consumer details and 
data - which is vital for the business - had to get a backup 
(better if it's in a completely different area of the world), 
it would require spending 2 times more on that system.

In conclusion, scenario planning is usefull for ASOS since it's 
in a part of a market that requires mass amounts of stock to 
be circulator from factory to consumer, so environmental 
disasters and other similar situations (fires) could be 
detrimental, especially when warehouses are set up for 
efficiency and not for. Planning for future unfortunate
situation also aligns the the companies objectives since it had
2 fires in short succession. ASOS is also a clothes 
manufacturer, and you cannot recover stock while services the
business sells will be less prone to disruption.
