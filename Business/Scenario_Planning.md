# 3.6.3 Scenario planning

Scenario planning is the process of anticipating possible changes in a business's situation and devising ways of dealing with
them. It incorporates the features of contingency plannning.
This risk assessment is where a business identifies, evaluates and prioritises risks and the precautions that may be taken to
protect against them.

Scenario planning is the process of looking at potential future situations and planning for those events.
The idea is that if we look creatively at what the future could look like, the drivers and the implications that a business can
create a series of strategies to handle those situations.

## Identifying key risks:
Identifying key risks through risk assesment, there are lots of key risks for a business, and these are usually idustry specific
but the ones that your exam board would like you to know about areL
1. Natural disasters,
2. IT systems failure,
3. Loss of key staff.

### 1. Natural disasters
- A disaster can strike any organisation, large of small. It can arrive in the shape of storm, flood , fire, earthquake and even 
  a tsunami,
- It may take some time for the business to return to normal operation after an incident,
- Climate change means UK businesses must plan for extremes of weather.

### 2. IT systems failure
- IT systems often contain data about: customers details including; emails, phone numbers, addresses, supplier's details, stock
  control information, how much stock is in the warehouse, location etc.
- If this information is lost it could be disastrous for the business (and possibly the customers).
- Scenario planning means that adequate firewalls, backups and alternatives are planned for and in place.

### 3. Loss of key staff
- When a key figure leaves whether it's a music band or a business, it can have serious reproduccusions on that 
  organisation's stakeholders.
- It is important to plan for the loss of key staff so that when it happens the business continues as normal.
- This is known as succession planning (see later in slide show).

## Risk mitigation
- There are degrees of risk mitigaton, and these depend on specific contextual influences and the overall attitude of the 
  deision-makers in the business.
- Again, there are lots that could be discussed but your exam board would like you to know about just four:
    - 1. Risk acceptance
    - 2. Risk avoidance
    - 3. Risk limitation
    - 4. Risk transference

### 1. Risk acceptance
- The balance between risk and reward is the very essence of business, the general idea is that without talking risks companies
  cannot generate profits.
- There is a world of difference between calculated risks, taken with planning and careful judgement, and risks taken 
  carelessly or unwittingly.
- An acceptance that there is an element of risk to every business.

### 2. Risk avoidance
- Risk avoidance is the elimination of hazards, activities and exposures that can negatively affect an organisation's dossets (?).
- Whereas risk management aims to control the damages and financial consequences of threatening events, risk avoidance seeks
  to avoid compromising events entirely.
- For example, a multinational pulling out of an unstable country.

### 3. Risk limiation
- Some business risks are both identifiable nad managebeable.
- Risks can be limited by:
    - Watching what is said and done to reduce the possibility of being sued,
    - Managing data carefully,
    - Become a LTD to gain limited liability,
    - Hiring a risk manager,
    - Having plenty of insurance ,
- This can also be done by investing in security systems such as CCTV for a business.

### 4. Risk transference
- Customers might buy car insurance in case they have a crash, not after they have a crash. It is protection against the risk
  (and the law).
- A company will buy business insurance, for example:
    - Public liability insurance covers the business for claims made agaisnt the business by a client or member of public for 
      accidental injury.
    - Employers' liability protects the business of an employee is injured and the business has been negligent.


## Planning for risk mitigation
- Mitigation means the action of reducting the severity, seriousness, or painfulness of something.
- Reducing the impact of a risk can be achieved in many ways, the ones your exam board would like to know about are:
1. Business continuity
2. Succession planing

### 1. Business continuity
- Business continuity is defined as the capability of the business to continue delivery of products or services at acceptable
  levels following a disruptive incident.
- Business continuity is often described as 'just common sense'. It is about taking responsibility for the business and 
  enabling it to stay on course in whatever storms it is forced to weather. It is about 'keeping calm and carrying on'.
- Business continuity is about buildin gand improving resilience in the business.
- Also, it means identifying the key products and services and the most urgent activities that underpin them and then,
  once that analysis is complete.
- It is about devising plans and strategies that will enable the business to continue operations and enalbe it to recover
  quickly and effectively from any type of disruption.

### 2. Succession planing
- Succession planning is a process for identifying and developing internal staff with the potential to fill key business 
  positions in the company.
- It increases the availability of experiened and capable employees that are prepared to assume these roles as they become
  available.
- In adition to training and development activities, succession planning programmes typeically include the provision of practical
  tailored work experience that will be relevant for future senior or key roles.
- There is a "9 box" theory to succession planning.
