# Controlling MNCs

- A MNC is a multinational corporation.
- This means that it trades or manufactures in more than 1
  country. It may also be known as a transnational 
  corporation or a multinational enterprise (MNE).

- The activities of MNCs can be controlled (so more extent). 
  This depends on; the MNC in question, the activities of the
  MNC and the country where this is all taking place.

# Political influence to control MNC activity
- Governments can apply pressure to attempt to change the 
  behaviour of MNCs.
- For example, MNCs have been avoiding paying tax in the UK:
  - Starbucks
  - Google
  - Amazon
- Since 2012, when the UK Chancellor at the time put tax avoidance on the G20 agenda, the UK had helped reform international tax
  rules and led the way with action to prevent corporations from paying little or no taxes.

## Benefits:
- MNCs may wish to get political approval from the government of the host nations, this may help trade and setting up in a new 
  country,
- If the MNC gains this political approval they may find trading smoother and less troublesome.

## Limitations:
- Polititians can be bribed, not so much an issue in the UK, but quite common in other countries.
- Some MNCs bring so much wealth and employment to an economy that a weaker government might ignore unethical activities.

# Laws used to control MNC activity
- If a country introduces laws to reduce pollution or protect children from child labour then this will all cost the MNC money to
  improve their practices.
- Quite often the MNC may ignore or flout these regulations
- Prime example is the Deepwater Horizon where the US government legally made BP pay compensation to Mexican fishermen affected by
  the disaster.

## Benefits
- Laws can be passed at any point to control the actions of an MNC which are already established in a country.
- Laws mean that consumers have some rights against the MNC.

## Limitations
- However, even if laws are introduced, they may still be broken by MNCs.
- The MNC may simply move production to a country where there are less laws or to avoid paying tax.
- The host nation does not want to lose the economic input of the MNC so this deters laws being passed.
- MNCs can afford expensive legal defence of any challenge.

# Pressure groups
- Pressure groups are organisations that campaign for changes in the law or new legislation in specific areas.
- Pressure groups can have a strong influence on the public opinion and behaviour of MNCs, if they want to avoid a PR disaster.
- Pressure groups such as:
  - Greenpeace
  - Friends of the earth
  - War on want

## Benefits
- Pressure groups can raise public awareness of MNCs activities in host countries.
- They can quickly alert large numbers of customers via social media and cause boycotts and other action.
- Pressure groups can create Public Relations (PR) problems for MNCs, which can lead to a change in their behaviour.

## Limitations
- The pressure group needs to be large and organised if it is to have any impact on changing the activities of the MNCs.
- The size and wealth of the largest MNCs mean they can easily counter or quieten pressure group activity.

# Social media
- Tools such as Twitter can see the swift mobilisation of public opinion and hence pressure on MNCs to change their behaviour.
- Social media can turn a product scare into a national crisis within hours.
- Social media networks can be used to orchestrate a boycott which will affect the sales and reputation of the MNC.

## Benefits
- Social media cna be a very powerfull way to change the behaviour of MNCs.
- For example, Twitter can put pressure on large corporations.
- Trip advisor has become a very powerful way for customers to alter policy, activity and services of large hotel chains.

## Limitations
- Social media can only affect short-term change the internet is a dynamic medium, fickle customers become bored easily and move
  on to the next scandal.
- A MNC can just dust itself down and carry on with very little impact on their activities.
