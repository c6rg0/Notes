## Key factors in change

# Defenition: Change management
Change management means planning and implementation of change
in a way that is mindful of those who will be affected by the 
changes.
Effective change management involves identifying, organizing
and implementing new methods of working in a business.
If a business attempts to force changes of the workforce - 
problems will arise. Changes must be; realistic, achievable
and measurable.

# Two types of change
Planned change:
- Refers to change which is planned by the top management of a
  business, proactive and long term.
This could be planned by:
- The board of directors
- The owners
- Senior leadership team

Emergent change:
- This is change that happens at any level in the organization
  and it the result of an event or need, reactive to events, 
  short-term.

## Factors affecting business change
- Organizational culture
- Organizational size
- Pace of change
- Resistance to change

# Organizational culture
- People are social beings who will adhere to cultural norms
  and values.
- Successful change is based on redefining those existing 
  norms and values and getting the commitment from workers 
  towards new ones.

# Organizational size
- As a business grows there will be inevitable changes to 
  within the organization.
- For example, as a business grows from ltd to plc, so that 
  they can raise more finance by floating shares on the stock
  market, this will mean huge changes fir the business.

# Pace of change
- One of the main problems with change is to align 
  expectations with reality.
- It's important to find a pace for change that is 
  approipriate for the situation and which takes into account 
  the needs and concerns of all stakeholders involved.
- Changes that happen too quickly will mean that employees 
  may experience stress.

## Resistance to change
- If the pace of change is too fast, it can create resistance
  from those who feel unprepared and that they don't have 
  enough time to adjust.
- It may not be properly thought through or planned, resulting
  in poor execution.
- The change may be difficult to communicate effectively to 
  all stakeholders, leading to misunderstandings and 
  confusion.

# If the pace of change is too slow, it can result in:
- A lack of adaptability and innovation,
- A loss of momentum, leading to delays or even the 
  abandonment of the change,
- Communication efforts becoming stagnant, leading to
  disinterest and disengagement.

# Resistance to change
- This is defined as behaviour which is intended to protect
  and indicidual from te effects real or imagined of change.
- Where employees try to block the intended change is called
  resistance to change.
- Managing resistance to change requires a thoughtful and
  strategic approach that takes into account the concerns
  of key stakeholders.

# Resistance to change - the employee perspective
- Resistance by employees may just be a defense mechanism
  caused by frustration and anxiety about the changes.
- Many employees fear that they will be unable to acquire
  the new skills (older staff on IT equipment) that will
  be required after the change.

# Managing resistance to change
- Resistance to change in a business is to be expected.
- Resistance can be managed by working with the employees,
  listening to their concerns and trying to understand them.
- Employees worry about; loss of status or power as a result 
  of the change, fear of personal failure, resentment, or 
  perception that change is not necessary.

# Ways to reduce resistance to change
- Deliver training programs,
- Focus on the positive aspects of change e.g. not commuting
  to the office if working from home.
- Design flexibility into the change, this will give employees
  time to adapt.
- Involve employees who might be impacted by the change, 
  consult with them and listen to their ideas.


Assess the likely impact on the corporate culture of a 
business such as Yahoo of banning staff from working at home:
(10 marks)

Corporate culture is the shared beliefs, norms and behaviours
that shapes a companies identity and defines how it operates
and interacts with its eployees and shareholders.
In this answer, I will assess the impact that banning staff
from working at home has on corporate culture.

One impact on the corporate culture of a business such as 
Yahoo or Google that have banned staff from working at home
is that is will allow employees to interact with each other 
more. An advantage of this is that employees might think 
of ideas as they talk with others - Google hires creative
people - which can more easily come into fruition compared
to if an employee though of it at home.

Another impact on the corporate culture of a business for 
banning staff from working at home is that it promotes a more
open and hands-on culture, where employees ask questions
directly to executives about the companies issues, and 
contribute directly to the business. The strength of this is
that it allows for potential future problems to be handled 
more effectiently if communication can be conducted in 
usual manner.

On the other hand, a negative impact on the corportate 
culture of a business that banned staff from working at home
is that it is likely to introduce resistance to change.
If employees in Yahoo have gotten usued to working remotely,

Another likely negative impact on the corporate culture is
that if the organization is big, then it's possible that the
change in corporate culture will be slow. If corporate 
culture is slow, it will result in a lack of adaptability,
innovation, and momentum which would produce delays. Along
with those impacts, miscommunication could occur. So unless 
Yahoo has a plan to
