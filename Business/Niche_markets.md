# Niche markets

# Defenition: Niche markets
- A niche market is a small specialised market that caters for a particular product or service. E.g. Harley Davidson motorbikes,
  Rolex watches.

# Defenition: Cultural diversity
- Diversity is the practice of include or involving people from a range of different social and ethnic backgrounds. In business,
  it is the recognition that groups of people across the globe have different interests and values.
- Cultural Diversity-Recognition that people across the globe have different interests and values.

# Cultural sensitivity
- Having cultural sensitivity, means understanding that people all over the world have different interests and values.
- For example, thanksgiving in the USA and Canada is more celebrated and important than Christmas so many businesses will be 
  closed on that day.

# International business communication
- Having a sensitivity to cultural diversity in communication is the key to smooth international business.
- For example a business greeting in Japan would be a bow - with different degrees having different meetings.

# Defenition: Global niche market
- A global niche is a very small market in each country, but the combination of all the countries together makes enough demand
  to make the business profitable.
- A global market niche is a subset of a global market.
- A global market niche is highly specialised and is characterised by very loyal customers and premium prices.
- Smaller, specialised parts of a global market where there are specific customer needs in more than one country are not met by
  the global mass market.

- Niche markets in many countries can build up to a significant market where a business can enjoy high demand.

# Global niche markets
- All business have costs, in a niche business these costs may be higher per item than in a mass market business.
- If the business is selling in a niche, then why not sell to this niche across the world and reduce the average costs and
  spread the fixed costs over more units sold.

# Selling in a global market niche

    - There is less competition and greater customer loyalty in niche markets.
    - Prices are likely to be higher and therefore profits may be greater.
    - Risk may be reduced - why?
    - Specialist products reduce PED and premium prices may be possible

- Drawbacks: 
    - If niche market has too many customers, it may attract the attention of the larger companies and make it harder for small
      companies to compete.
    - Co-ordination and communication may be more difficult across differing brands and markets.
    - Some products may require unique ingredients or production techniques reducing the scope for economies of scale.
