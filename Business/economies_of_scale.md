# 3.2.1 Growth:

## Starter:
- Money
- Charity
- Expansion

- Business growth: The point at which a business needs to expand and seeks options to generate more pofits.
  Expanding the sales revenue of a business, probably in hope that profits will increase too.


## Objectives of growth:

- There are lots of reasons that a business will want to grow and expand, some may be speific to the owners or the industry,
  the four that your exam board would like you to know about are:
	1. To achieve economies of scale (internal and external).
	2. To increase market power and customers and suppliers.
	3. To increase market share and brand recognition.
	4. To increase profitability.


### 1:
- Growth enables a business to benefit from economies of scale with a huge impact on the cost of production.
- If production is less expensive because average costs have fallen, then this can increase the profit 
  margins of the business, or they can choose to reduce prices to gain more market share.


Benefits of economies of scale:

As a business expands, it can achieve competetive advantages in multiple ways:

	- Having more funds to buy stock and obtain better deals through bulk purchasing. 
	- Having mroe funds to hire specialist staff. 
	- Building a stronger reputation, making banks more willing to provide loans.

	We call this economies of scale (EOS).


Economies of scale and average costs:

- Economies of scale occur when unit costs or average costs fall as a result as 
  an increase in the level of output of the business.
- The more they make, the cheaper it gers per item.
- Any economies of scale question should be about how increasing output means a business 
  can lower its average costs.


Economies of scale formulas:

$ VC = Variable Costs
$ Total costs of production = VC x Output + FC
$ Average costs per unit = TC / Output


Calculation:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   Output in units	|    Variable cost	|     Fixed costs for the	|   Total costs of     |Average cost |
			|      per unit		|       production run	        |     production       |   per unit  |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
100			| $2			| $500 				| 2 x 100 + 500 =      |700 / 100 =  |
			|			|				| $700		       | $7	     |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
300			| $2			| $500				| 2 x 300 + 500 =      |1100 / 300 = |
			|			|				| 1100		       |$3.67 (2dp)  |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
400			| $4			| $500				| 4 x 400 + 500 =      |2100 / 400 = |
			|			|				| 2100		       |5.25	     |

Different defenitions for economies of scale:

Financial EOS:
- Large companies can benefit from better interest deaels on loans and wider sources of cheap finance they
  may attract more investment from shareholders.

Marketing EOS:
- Large companies can attract specialist buyers who don't waste money buying stock that will not sell.
  They also have specialist sellers/marketing staff who ensure that goods will sell. 
  Big companies benefit significantly from being able to buy in bulk and gain dicounts which reduce their costs.

Techinical EOS:
- These are the advantages that large firms have when it omes to the production process. Large firms can afform 
  to employ specialist labour which improve productivity and reduce average costs.

Managerial EOS:
- Large companies have the money/resources to attract specialist and experienced manager who make the most effective 
  business decisions and increase effieciency over time.

Risk- Bearing EOS:
- Large companies benefit from having wider, more diversified prodcut range. This means that they are better able 
  to withdraw the risk of a fall in demand for one good or service.


2. To increase market power over customers and suppliers:
- Another objective of a business wanting to grow may be to reduce the power of suppliers and customers.
- This is the short to medium term objective which flows from the longer-term objective of
  the business to increase their profitability.


3. To increase market share and brand recognition:
- In dynamic and competetive markets, businesses may seek to grow to achieve increased market share.
  For example, the Fast-Moving Consumer Giids FMCG in the UK is very driven my market share.
- Other businesses may seek to merge or acquire companies in the same industry to aqcuire recognized brands.


4. To increase profitability:
- Many businesses seek to grow and expand to increase their profitability.
- This means as they increase their output, production becomes cheaper per unit (EOS) and the whole business 
  becomes more profitable because costs are reduce.


Problems arising from growth:
- As a business grows, this brings with it a set of problems. There are lots of inductry specific ones, 
  but the main ones your exam board would like you to know about is:

1. Diseconomies of scale:
- As the business grows it might expand the scale of production beyong the minimum effient scale.
- At this point the average costs per unit start to rise as production increase.

Internal diseconomies of scale: 
- Communication, co-ordination, motivation.

External diseconomies of scale:
- Overcrowding in industrial areas, traffic congestion, price of land and labour rises.

Minimum effient scale
- The minimum effient scale is the smallest level of output at which a business can produce 
  goods at the lowest average cost.

Diseconomies of scale can cause lack of motivation:
- Workers in large companies may feel demotivated - with little say in their working life.
- This can lead to powerlessness and alienation.
- Means increased absenteeism and lateness, which can lead to:
	- Reduction in productivity
	- Lower output per worker
	- Means increased unit costs

Diseconomies of scale causes a lack of co-ordination:
- As a company grows and take on new staff, makes new products buys' new premises, all 
  this need to be coordinated.
- All resources need to be controlled so that operations can run smoothly.
- Workers may need monitoring which can add to costs.
- May need more managers which increase average cost per unit.

Diseconomies of scale formula:
(Already written this earlier)
Total costs of production = VC x Output + FC
Average cost per unit = TC / Output

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 Output in units	| Variable cost	        | Fixed costs for the	        | Total costs of        | Average cost  |
			| per unit		| production run	        | production            | per unit      |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
 100			| $3.25			| $500 				| 3.25 x 100 + 500 =    |8.25           |
			|			|				| 325+500 = 825         | 	        |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
 300			| $3.25			| $500				| 1475                  |4.92           |
			|			|				| 		        |               |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
 500			| $3.25			| $500				| 2125			|4.25           |
			|			|				| 		      	|	        |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~|
 600			| 3.25			| 4,000			 	| 5950			|9.92		|
			|			|				|			|		|
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


2. Overtrading:
- Overtrading is where a business accepts more orders that it can cope with.
- This can result in cash flow problems.
- For example, if the business accepts a large order which will not be paid by the customer
  until the end of the three months time then theywill not be able to fulfil further large 
  orders if they came in as they will have no cash to buy stock with.

3. Internal communication:
- As the size of the workforce increases there will be less face-to face commuication.
- Takes a long time for messages to get through as there are many layers of managment.
- Less effective communication:
	- Means mistakes made
	- Means more wastage
	- Therefore higher average unit costs
