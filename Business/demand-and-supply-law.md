Demand and supply graph:
    x axis = quantity demand/supply
    y axis = price
    bottom left to top right line = supply
    top left to bottom right line = demand

A change in the price of a product will give a movement along
the demand curve - if the product price increases, the demand 
for the product will fall. Similarly, if the price of the
product falls, demand will rise. 

The quantity of the product that a business is willing to 
supply is determined by the price at which it can sell a 
product. A change in the price of the product will cause a 
movement along the supply curve e.g. if the product price
increases, the supply for the product will rise.

Price factors - price of the good that we consider
Non price factors - subsidies, complementary products, consumer
income, consumer trends, advertising/branding, demographics,
seasonal changes, external shocks.

Supply:

Non price factors -
