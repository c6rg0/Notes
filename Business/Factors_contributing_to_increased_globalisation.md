# 4.1.3 Factors contributing to increased globalisation

## Globalisation
- Globalisation is the process by which the world is becoming
  increasingly interconnected as a result of massively 
  increased trade and cultural exchange.
- The biggest companies are no longer national firms but
  multinational (MNCs) with subsidaries in many countries.
- Global markets are international markets created by
  firms exporting, importing or offshoring.

## Factors contributing to increased globalisation
- If globalisation is the interconnection of countries, then
  the factors that have lead to an increase in this 
  connectivity are:
    a) Reduction of international trade barriers (trade 
       liberalisation),
    b) Political change,
    c) Reduced cost of transport and communication,
    d) Increased significance of global (transnational) 
       companies,
    e) Increased investment flows (FDI),
    f) Migration (within and between economies),
    g) Growth of the global labour force,
    h) Structural change.

## 1. Reduction of international trade barriers
- Trade liberalisation is the process by which international
  trade is made easier through relaxation of tarrifs and 
  barriers.
- This is the opposite to protectionism.

- In 1947, General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) was
  created. 
- The world felt the benefits of many rounds of multilateral 
  trade liberalisation.
- It raised living standards around the world as it allowed 
  developing nations to export their goods to more 
  industrialised ones, without having to pay huge tariffs.

### Benefits of GATT
- GATT means new jobs for unskilled workers,
- Countries enjoyed trade benefits of between $250 and $680
  billion dollars income a year,
- Labour intensive production manufacturers in developing
  nation enjoyed comparative advantage because of low
  labour costs.

### World trade organisation (WTO)
- WTO was created by GATT in 1994 an exists to reduce barriers
  to trade and to ensure that countries keep to the agreements
  they have made.
- The organisation also deals with complaints between members,
  organising negotiations and, if necessary, making judgements
  against a country.
- It encourages trade liberalisation by operating a system of
  trade rules and by providing a forum for the negotialtion of
  trade disputes.

### Why tarrifs are imposed?
- Government want to protect their domestic businesses so they
  use; tarrifs, quotas and legal regulations to slow the rate
  of imports into a country.
- They might want to stop imports which will flood the market
  with cheaper foreign versions.
- Tariffs also generate important sources of income for poorer
  countries.
- Liberalisation is the easing or dropping of tariffs and 
  quotas.

### Benefits of trade liberalisation
- Trade liberalisation is the process of taking down the 
  barriers to trade between nations, removing quotas and 
  tariffs.
- Consumers ultimately benefit because liberalised trade can
  help to lower prices and broaden the range of quality goods
  and services available - because they are now allowed to buy
  imported goods.

### Benefits to business of trade liberalisation 
- Companies can benefit because liberalised trade diversifies
  risks and channels resources to where returns on investment
  are the highest.
- Trade opennes also means: competition, investment and 
  increases to productivity.
- The main industries in Uganda that have benefitted: sugar, 
  beverages, tobacco, cotton, textiles, cement and steel 
  production.

### Drawbacks of trade liberalisation
- Competition can intensify between businessses, between
  nations and profit margins can end up being squeezed.
- Employment that has been created by lower trade barriers,
  may only be temporary or menial.
- Increased trade can mean pollution or over-cultivtion of 
  land to keep up with the new demand.
- Developing nations can become economically dependent on
  industrialised ones.


## 2. Political change
- Politics used to only be carried out by individual
  governments who wanted to protect the interests of their
  country.
- Politics now happens on a global scale with regular meetings
  beteen heads of state at summits where power is devolved to 
  governents in trading blocs such as the EU and organisations
  such as the WTO.
- This has led to less protectionist policies and more open 
  trade beween nations.

### The WTO
- The world trade organisation (WTO) is the only global 
  organisation dealing with the rules of trade between 
  nations.
- At its heart is the WTO agreements, negotiated and signed by
  the bulk of the world's trading nations and ratified in 
  their parliments.

### The G7
- The group of seven (G7) is an informal forum of seven 
  advanced economies: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, 
  the USA and UK.
- These countries are recognised as mahor advanced economies
  and collectively account for a significant portion of 
  global wealth.
- G7 members typically have higher national wealth and very
  high HDI scores, reflecting stron living standards and 
  economic development.

## 3. Reduced cost of transport and communication
- Developments in transport, for edxample jet aircraft and
  container ships, have reduced the cost of transport per 
  unit, so products are affordable for customers in foreign
  nations making trade between nations more realistic.
- The physical distance between countries is unchanged, but
  cheaper transport and communications increase connectivity
  and reduce the tiime taken for goods to arrive, so shrink
  the world in trade terms.

- Communication and trade via the internet has meant an 
  explosion in globalisation and has been a huge catalyst for
  change.
- Messasges can be sent instantly and for free via 
  telecommunications systems such as e-mail or Skype.
- Far away countries are no longer isolated from the global 
  marketplace.


## 4. Increased significance of global companies
- Globalisation has been caused by some large companies
  setting up or buying existing businesses in other countries.
- These businesses that operate in other countries are called
  MNCs and are from the developed countries (G7).
- E.g. Starbucks, Coca-Cola.

## 5. Increased investment flows
- FDI stands for Foreign Direct Investment. A FDI flow is the
  movement of investment across borders. The FDI may be in the
  form of buying a foreign company, buying shares in a foreign
  company or investing in a foreign company.

- Business located outside of important market trading blocs
  will invest in a busines or set up production inside the
  trading bloc to get around tarrifs, e.g. Honda, Nissan and
  Toyota manufacturing in the UK.
- This has led to globalisation, nore companies in more 
  countries.
- FDI can give a country more consumer income, jobs, GDP 
  growth , skill transfer, and the local business will also
  benefit from having consumers with money to spend.

## 6. Migration
- Migration can be within a country (from one town to another)
  or between countries.
- Human migration is the movement of people from one place
  to nother with the intention of setting permanently in a new
  location.
- Migration provides a welcome source of able-bodied workers
  for business.

## 7. Growth of the global labour force
- A global labour force is a international pool of workers,
  emerging since globalisation and includes those who are:
    - Migrant workers,
    - Working in export,
    - Employed to MNCs,
    - Employed by offshoring companies.
- The global labour force is around 3 billion worldwide.

## 8. Structural change
- Structural change is an economic condition that occurs when
  an industry changes the way is operates.
- As a country develops it moves away from primary sector 
  businesses and employment (agriculture) to manufacturing as
  it becomes industrialised.
- It can further develop into a knowledge economy - such as 
  the UK - which specialises in tertiary businesses such as;
  banking, IT services and insurance.

- The countries that are able to pull themselves out of 
  poverty are those who move away from primary sector business
  (agriculture).
- The economy grows as there is more productivity in the 
  secondary sector - manufacturing increases and net incomes 
  rise.
