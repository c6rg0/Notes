# Content analysis:
Content analysis is a type of observational research method that involves studying people inderectly, through qualitative
data. This is done through any type of communication produces e.g. video, audio recordings/transcripts, written responses
or even children's drawrings.
The aim of content analysis is to describe an summarise this communication in a systematic way so that an overall conclusion
can be drawn.

Coding is the initial stage of content analysis. The use of agreed codes/themes to analyse the qualitative data and turn it into
quantitative data.

## What are codes?
Researchers will agree on codes (these may also be reffered to categories) that will be used to measure behaviour, turning 
qualitative data into quantitative data.
For example, if researchers are analysing interview transcripts about student attitudes towards exercise, they may agree to tally
how many times they read the following code:
- Exerice helps with mental health
- Exercise is boring
- Exercise helps with concentration

## Why are codes used?
Qualitative data can be extensive in its nature, so coding can be helpful in reaching succint conclusions about this data.
They also allow qualitative material to be changed to a quantitative format, which can then be used for further (statistical)
analysis.
Researchers can agree on them in advance, and others can be trained to use them. This helps with the internal validity of 
research.
For example:
- The transcript of a spoken conversation covers an argument between a married couple in which the words 'blame' and 'upset' 
occur frequently.

## Coding in content analysis:
Waynforth & Dunbar (1995) conducted a content analysis analysis by analysing lonely heart adverts in newspapers to see if men 
and women were looking for different things in relationships:
- They looked at 881 loney heart adverts,
- They found that men aimed their adverts at younger women and tended to cite their resources as being more important that their
  attractiveness,
- Women aimed their adverts at older males and mentioned their attractiveness more than else,
- The researchers codified the above themes and gave them numerical values to that the qualitative responses were transformed
  into quantitative data.

### Process of coding:
- The researcher formulates their reasearch question,
- They select a sample of pre-existing qualitative data sources (some of which they may have conducted; some done by others),
- The researcher desides on the coding of the categories/coding units (e.g. the use of the term x throught the material),
- The researcher works through the data using a tally,
- The researcher will then need to test for reliability via:
    - Test-retest reliability: Run the content analysis on the same sample (the material used first time round) and compare the 
      results,
    - Inter-rater reliability: A second rater conducts the content analysis with the same coding categories and data and compares
      them.
    - If the results are similar, then this shows good inter-rater reliability.

## How to conduct a content analysis:
Content analysis like any observation or research involves design decisions about the following:
- Sampling method: how material should be sampled (e.x. time sampling or event sampling),
- Recording data: should data be transcibed or recorded for instance using video?
- Analysis and representing data: how material should be categorised or coded in order to sumarise it, should calculations or 
  themes be used.

### Strenghts
- Reliability: it is a reliable way to analyse qualitative data as the coding untis are not open to interpretation and so are 
  applied in the same way over time and with different researchers.
- High ecological validity: It is typically naturally occuring data such as newspapers, TV shows, social media posts, or 
  open-ended survey responses. This means the material reflects real-life communication and behaviour.
- Ethical issues: It provides a way to circumnavigate many potential ethical issues (e.g. protection from harm).
- Flexible: can provide both qualitative and quantitative data depending on the aims of the research.

### Limitations
- Subjectivity: Although content analysis aims to be systematic, the process of identifying and categorising themes or behaviours
  can involve subjective judgement. Different researchers may interpret the same content differently.
- Loss of meaning: When qualitative data is reduced to categories or tallies, some of the richness and depth of meaning can be 
  lost. Subtle nuances, tone, or context may not be fully captured in the coding process, potentially oversimplifying complex
  data.


#### Outline how the researchers could conduct their content analysis (4 marks):
First, the researchers should consider how they will interact with the interview transcript, and whether they're going to 
organize and interact with the transcipt off of time (time-sampling) or on an event basis (event-sampling). Then, they should
decide how to use codes, becuase they can either use them off of the themes mentioned or by specific words. Some examples of
the codes the researchers could use are:
