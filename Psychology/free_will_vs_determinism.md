##### Free will vs Determinism

## Free will
Free will is the idea that people can play an active role and have choice in how they behave.
The assumption is that individuals are free to choose their behaviour and are self-determined. For example, people can make 
a free choice as to whether commit a crime or not.
Therefore,, a person is responsible for their own actions, and it is impossible to predict human behaviour with any precision.
There is a recognition that people respond to environmental pressure and biological drivers, however, it does not see this as
truly governing behaviour.

This debate recognises cause and effect in behaviour and the influence of factors such as the environment, but argues
that we ourselves direct our behaviour through our will so that we make choices and our behaviour is volountary.
It could nen regarded as the essense of humanity in that it distinguishes us from animals as we are not simply responding
to our instincts or the demands of the situations we find themselves.
Humanistic psychologist support this perspective.

Humanism is the only approach that advocates complete free will, while the others see behaviour as being controlled in some
way. 
Humanism assumes that individuals are unique and not merely products of genes or the envionment.
It does however, accept that there are internal and external influences on our behaviour, but it argues that we are free to 
regulate out own behaviour as we are not passive recipients of these influences.
We are actively involved in the process of shaping our lives and experiences.

> Free will is an illusion. People always choose the percieved path of greatest pleasure.

## Evaluation for free will
Face validity: 
- In everyday scenario, we appear to be making our own decisions. Therefore, the idea of free will has good face validity
  because we appear to constantly exercise it.

Illusion of free will:
- A person may choose to do something but these choice are determined by previous reinforcement contingencies, as suggested
  by the behaviourist approach. This is a hard deterministic stance.

Challange of the idea of free will:
- Benjamin Libet et al (1983) recorded activity in motor areas of the brain before the person had conscious awareness to move
  their finger.
- Chun Soon et al (2008) found activity in the prefrontal cortex 7-10 seconds before they picked the number randomly (?)


#### Determinism
Determinism is the view that free will is an illusion, and that peoples behaviours are governed by internal or external
forces over which they have no control.

Hard determinism - the theory that human behaviour and actions are wholly predetermined by internal and external factors, and 
therefore humands do not have free will or ethical accountability. Behaviourists support this.

Soft determinism - the theory that there are constraints on our behaviour but within these limitations we are free to make 
some choices. Cognitive psyhchologists support this perspective.

Biological - the influence of genes, hormones, neurotransmitters cause behavious. 

Environmental - behaviour is shaped by learning, being rewarded and punished for certain behaviours, associating stimuli with 
response and so on.

Psychic - behaviour is shaped by unconscious conflicts and forces we are not aware of, so even if our decisions seem like
they are due to free will, this is just an illusion as it is tied to unconscious conflicts that we have repressed from childhood.

Emphasis on causal explanations:
A basic principl of science is that every event in the universe has a cause and that cause can be explained using general laws
(hard determinism). It's knowledge of causes and formulations of laws which are important as they allow scientists to predict
and control events in the future.

Stephen Mobley was a convicted murderer who's aterneys 
made the novel argument that Mobely was genetically 
predisposed to seek violent solutions to conflict. His family
tree was analyzed by researchers, and in the course of doing
so, 4 generations, including uncles, aunts and a grandfather
were responsible for acts of violence and aggression ranging
from serious crimes (including murder and rape) to alcoholism,
explosive tempers, antisocial behaviours and extreme 
spousal abuse.

Charles Witman was an American mass murderer and marine 
veteran who became known as the "Texas Tower Sniper".
Investigating officers have found that Witman had visited
several physicians in the year before the shooting.
An autopsy has found that he had a tumor in the amygdala -
the part of the brain responsible for emotional regulation
and aggression (or control of it).

#### Evaluation of determinism
- It is consistent with the aims of science.
- The hard determinism stance is not consistent with the way that our legal system operates.
- Determinism as an approach is unfalsifiable. 
- It has implications for criminal responsibility - a potential excuse for criminal acts.

Science is heavily deterministic in its search for causual relationships as it seeks to discover whether x causes y, or whether
the independent variable causes changes in the dependent variable.
While experiments are keen to establish causation, where X causes Y, they typically discount or minimize the importance of 
extraneous variables that have been controlled. Furthermore, expreiments often make sweeping generalisations about human 
behaviou and don't acknowledge that at a different time, in a different place, our behaviour may not be influenced by
X. 


# Discuss two or more types of determinism. Refer to the case of Dancho as part of your discussion.

Determinism is the idea that free will is an illusion, and that our beheviour is governed by internal and external forces 
that we have no control over.

One type of determinism is environmental determinism. Environmental determinism is that our behaviour is shaped by learning - 
being rewarded and punished, and that we learnt to associate stimuli with response and more. Environmental determinism can 
be seen in Dancho's case since he was taught to play the piano by his father who was a concert pianist, and after he attended 
a specialist music school where he spent many hours each day practicing the piano - he ended up having a passion in playing 
the piano - he even said that "To hear the applause in the concert hall is what I live for. Even If I wanted to stop playing, 
I could not". The same type of determinism can be seen in other skilled individuals who end up having children, with them being
rewarded more for partaking in said passion, they end up unknowingly passionate as well; "My earliest memories are of notes 
and melodies".
The advantage of this type of determinism is that a states a clear cause and effect relationship - learning the piano and 
becoming just like his father rewarding most from the people he cared about.
However, a problem with this is that it doesn't explain the formation of passion. It may explain why he has developed such 
skill and the initial enjoyment, but it falls flat quick for explaining his life long passion.

On the other hand, you could argue for the idea of Dancho's passion for playing the piano being biological. With his father
being a concert pianist, possibly having the optimal genetics for playing the piano and passing them down to his son, 
with his childhood being filled with playing the piano, the environment just activated the necessary biology to make him 
a talented musician. 
A stength of the biological type of determinism is that it can be scientifically tested using a DNA  

A problem with this type of determinism is that it removes any possibility of his talent and fame being all
