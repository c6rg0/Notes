# Gender and culture bias

## The issue of gender bias: Universality and Bias
- When a theory is described to be universal, it means that 
  it can apply to all people, irrespective of gender and 
  culture.
- Universality occurs when a researcher has not considered 
  the fact that there is no 'one size fits all' in terms of 
  human.
- Bias means to influence, typically is an unfair direction
  and suggests that a person's views are distorted in some 
  way.
- In psychology there is evience that gender is prevented in 
  a biased way. This bias leads to differential treatment of 
  males and females, based on stereotypes and not real 
  differences.
- Bias may lead to researchers forming conclusions which 
  favour universality.

## Alpha bias
- Alpha bias occurs when researchers over-emphasize the 
  differences between males and females (Males are aggressive;
  females are nurturing). 
- Alpha bias usually (but not always) favours and de-values 
  females (possibly because most psycological research has 
  been conducted on men).
- Differences between males and females allow for no 
  flexibility when it comes to alpha vias.
    - Males/female traits, behaviours and characteristics are
      presented as fixed, stable and inevitable,
    - Freud's psychodynamic theory is guilty of such 
      inflexibility with its insistence that women are 
      essential inferior to men.

## Moral development
Kohlberg's theory of moral development states that there are 
6 developmental stages, each more adequate at responding to 
moral dilemmas than its predecessor.
Kohlberg followed the development of moral judgement far
beyond the ages studoed earlier bt Piaget.
It has 6 stages and three levels, pre-conventional (how can
I avoid punishment?), conventional (social norms), and post-
conventional (universal ethical principles and social contract
orientation).

Gilligan made a theory of moral development as a result of
bias where girls scored predominantly at stage 3, while most
boys scored at stage 4, and this made it seem like men 
reached higher levels of morality than women. However, 
Kolhergs theory was formulated exlusively through research 
with young white males.
It has 3 stages as well, but with 2 transitionary periods
in between. The stages are more focused on care and meeting 
their own or others needs over justice. As a result, some
femenist psychologists have expressed concern that it
reinforces traditional ideas about femeninity.

## Beta bias
- Beta bias occurs when researches ignore or downplay 
differences between males and females.
- There is also evidence of beta bias in psychological 
research. Male and female participants are used in most 
studies, but there is normally no attempt to analyse the data 
to see whether there are significant sex differences.
- Where differences are found, it may be possible that these 
occur because researchers ignore the differential treatment 
of participants.
- For example, Rosenthal (1966) reported that male 
  experimenters were more pleasant, friendly, honest, and
  encouraging with female than with male participants.
  This led to Rosenthal to conclude: "Male and female 
  subjects may, psychologically, simply not be in the same
  experiment at all".

- The result of beta bias in psychological research is that
  we end up with a view of human nature that is supposed to
  apply to men and women alike, but in fact, has a male or
  androcentric bias.
- For example, Asch's (1955) conformity studies involved all
  male participants, as did may of the other conformity 
  studies (e.g. Perrin & Spencer 1980) and therefore it was
  assumed that females would respond the same way.
- In a review of the research on sex differences, Maccoby
  and Jacklin (1974) concluded that there were only 4
  differences between boys and girls, including:
    - Girls have greater verbal ability,
    - Boys have greater visual and spacial abilities,
    - Boys have greater arithmetical ability, a differnce that
      only occurs at adolescence,
    - Girls are less aggressive than boys.

## Androcentrism:
- Anrocentrism means male-centered; it results from and 
  perpetuates a worldview that is consistently male. It can
  be conscious or unconscious.
- The male viewpoint/behaviour becomes the 'norm' or the model
  for behaviour generally which could lead to female behaviour
  being viewed as 'abnormal' e.g:
    - Research by Milgram (1963), Asch (1951) and Zimbardo
      (1973) used all-male samples to draw conclusions about
      the nature of, respecively, destructive obedience,
      normative conformity and conformity to social roles.
        - This assumes that the findings from this research
          represent a general population when in fact 50%
          of the population was unrepresented in each study.
    - Males who express strong emotions e.g. anger are likely
      to be seen as 'impressive/assertive/rational', whereas 
      the same degree of emotion expressed by a woman may be
      labelled 'bossy/shrill/hormonal'.
    
## Evaluation of gender bias: 
### Strengths
- Researchers who are aware of gender bias may practice 
  reflexivity,
    - This in turn can lead to good practice and the modelling
      of an ideal for other researchers to aspire to.
*(NOTE: the above point does not suggest that gender bias* 
*in and of itself is a strength, but rather that increased*
*awareness of it can be turned into a strength).*
- Cornwell et al (2013) showed that women are successful when
  it comes to learning because they are more attentive, 
  flexible, and organised.
    - Stereotypes that the male model of behaviour is superior
      are therefore challenged.
    - This is an example of reverse alpha bias which can help
      to readdress inequalities.

### Limitations
- As well as ignoring the female experience in psychology, 
  there are other potential consequences of gender bias e.g:
    - Female researchers may recieve less funding than their
      male colleagues as their role as serious psychologists
      may be questioned,
    - Research which ignores or de-values the female 
      experience/perspective is that prejudice, discrimination
      and sexism are viewed as normal and acceptable.
- There is some external validity to gender bias in research 
  as the lack of female representation can give rise to the
  idea that women generally are not as important or 
  high-status as men.


## Cultural bias
- This is when research and theories conducted developed in
  one cultre are applied, perhaps inapropriately, to another.
- In psychology, most of the research and practising 
  psychologists are western-based, fore example the USA and 
  Western Europe. This causes bias in that one cultural 
  background is dominant, reducing the extent to which 
  theories can be said to be universal.
- For example, research into conformity has shown quite 
  different results when conducted in non-Western cutlures,
  as has research into attachment behaviour.

## The issue of cultural bias
- Due to most psychological research being conducted in 
  western counties as well as participants, the theories
  produced often have a western world view and suffer from 
  cultural bias as it is assumed the findings can be applied
  to other cultures.
- One way to deal with cultural bias is to recognise it when
  it occurs. Smith and Bond found, in their 1998 survey of
  European textbooks on social psychology, that 66% of the
  studies were American, 32% European, and only 2% from the 
  rest of the world. This suggests that much psychological 
  research is severely unrepresentative and can be greatly
  improved by simply selecting different cultural groups 
  to study.

- Heightened awareness of cultural diversity has led to the
  development of 'Inidgenous psychologies': theories drawing
  explicitly on the particular experiences of people in 
  different cultural contexts.
- One example is Afrocenrism, a movement which suggests that
  because all black people have their roots in Africa, 
  theories about them must recognise the African context of
  behaviours and attitudes.
- This is an example of an emic approach, which emphasises the
  uniqueness of every culture and looks at behaviours from the
  inside of a particular cultural system.
- This matters because it has led to the emergence of theories
  that are more relevant to the lvies and cultures of people
  not only in Africa, but also to those far removed from their
  African origins.
- The development of indigenous psychologies is often seen as 
  as a strength of cultural relativism, however, are 
  Afrocentric theories not as culturally biased as those they
  claim to replace.

## Ethnocentrism
- The belief that one culture is inherently superior or 
  'better' than others. This manifests as behaviours not
  matching the western norms being seen as deviant or 
  inferior.
- For example, in the strange situation, infants who were 
  securely attached were seen as 'happiest', this being seen
  as the 'best' attachment type. This does not consider
  how childcare practices differ in other cultures.

- Ainsworth's research into attachment style is a good example
  of ethnocentrism:
    - This involves a belief (conscious or not) that one's own
      culture is superior to other cultures, thereby rendering
      other cultures as 'strange/abnormal/odd/primitive'.
- In the case of ainsworth's 'Strange Situation' study, the 
  finding reflected a very white, western, individualist e.g:
    - It is normal for securely attached children to show 
      some seperation anxiety,
    - It is abnormal for insecure resitstant children to show
      too much seperation anxiety,
    - It is abnormal for insecure avoidant children to show 
      independence from the caregiver.
- This issue with teh above findings is that subsequent cross-
  cultural attachment research (Van Ijzendoorn & Kroonberg, 
  1988) found that:
    - Japanese children show high seperation anxiety due to 
      the amount of time they spend with their mothers before
      going to school,
    - German children show far less seperation anxiety due to
      the instilling of indipendence in them by their mothers.
    - By labelling the above attachment behaviours 'insecure',
      Ainsworth was ignoring the role of culture in 
      attachment, which Van Ijendoorn & Kroonenberg addressed 
      in their research.
- When ethnocentrism goes unchecked, it can produce an imposed
  etic.

## Cultural relativism
- Cultural relativism is the idea that cultures can only be
  understood from within that culture.
- Etic approaches look at behaviours from outside of a 
  culture, trying to appply universal laaws, whereas emic 
  appproaches study cultures from within, looking at what 
  behaviours are specific to a culture.
- Research which is developed in one culture and 
  inappropriately applied to another is an example of the 
  imposed etic (assuming that one way of doing things can be 
  applied to everywhere).
- Berry suggested that psyhological theories should be 
  considered to be culturally relative - they were developed
  in one (usually) Western culture, and therefore they reflect
  the norms and values of that culture.

- Universal bias is a type of etic research as it assumes 
  general laws of behaviour derived from the study of only one
  culture.
    - Cultural relativism turns this idea on its head: a 
      culture can only be understood by a researcher by 
      conducting a 'deep dive' into that culture from inside
      the culture itself.
        - A researcher who is an 'outsider' in terms of that
          culture should not make assumptions nor should they
          attempt to make sense of their findings using their
          restricted culturual view.
- Replicating studies which were originally conducted in one 
  (generally American) culture can yeild different results
  e.g: (slide 23)
