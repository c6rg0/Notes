Explain one way in which each of the ethical issues you have 
identified in question one could have been dealt with (8 marks)

One way that informed consent could have been dealt with is by
getting the permission from the students parents. The children
are not old enough to consent, so their parents need to 
give consent for, this could have been dealt simply by asking
the parents.
A way of dealing with deception is to get approval from the 
ethics commitee. If deception is required, and it's deemed 
acceptable, there is a possibility that the study can go 
ahead. Along with this, debriefing will have to occur.
The teacher could have dealt with confidentiality by keeping
the students/participants data secure. This would involve
not disclosing participants results/data with anyone, 
besides the participants individually and privately, or with
other experimenters (only if required). 
To deal with protection from hard


# British psychological society (BPS):
- This organisation for professional psychologists. They
  published a code of ethics which should be followed by 
  anyone involved in psychological research.
- This provides comprehensive guidelines on the requirements
  of ethical research that determines whether an 
  experimenter's proposed research is acceptable, or it 
  breaches any ethical principles.
- BPS guidelines match with to the ethical issues that we 
  have discussed as they ensure that participants are treated
  with respect, and protected throughout research.
