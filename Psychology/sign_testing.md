# Levels of measurement and sign testing

## Inferential statistics
- Inferential statistics allows researchers to draw 
  conclusions or make predictions about a larger population 
  based on data collected from a smaller sample.
- It involved using statistical tests to determine whether 
  observed effects or relationships in the sample data are 
  likely to exist in the population or if they occured by 
  chance.
- They are an objective way to determine whether a hypothesis
  can be accepted, or whether it should be rejected.

## Factors affecting choice
- In psychological research, there are several key 
  considerations that researchers must take into accoutn when 
  chosing an appropriate statistical test:
    - Research aim - is the goal of the research to identify
      a difference or a correlation?
    - Design of the study - If the studt is looking for a 
      difference, are the conditions related or unrelated?
    - Level of measurement - Is it nominal, ordinal or 
      interval?

- Each of these factors influences the decision and helps 
  ensure that the test used produces valid, interpretable, 
  and replicable results.

## Levels of measurement
- In psychology, there are different ways that variables can 
  be measured and psychologists typically group measurements
  into one of the following: 
    - Nominal data - Frequency count of data
    - Ordinal data - Scores are ranked in order
    - Interval data - A continuous scale with no absolute 0

### Nominal data
- Nominal data refers to a type of data that is in the form
  of categories.
- It is reffered to as discrete data, which means one item 
  can only appear in one category.
- It does not enable sensitive analysis as it does not yield a
  numerical result for each participant.

- Strength:
    - Nominal data is easily generated from closed questions
      on a questionare or interview. This can often be 
      generated quickly and can therefore be tested in a 
      timely matter for reliability. The mode is the measure 
      of central tendency which can be applied to nominal 
      data.

- Limitation:
    - Since there is no scale of reference for nominal data, 
      which is simply categorical, it's not possible for the
      data to express it's true complexity and can therefore
      appear overly simplistic. There is no measure of 
      dispersion which can be applied to nominal data.


### Ordinal data
- Ordinal data refers to data which is represented in a 
  ranking form, for example 1-10.
- Ordinal data can be categorised and ranked in an order, 
  howecer, you cannot say anything about the intervals between
  the rankings.
- There are no equal intervals between each unit.
- A weakness of it is hat it lacks precision as its based on 
  the subjective opinions of people.

- Strenght:
    - Ordinal data provides more details than nominal data
      as the scores are ordered in a linear fashion.

- Limitation:
    - The intervals between scores are not of equal value. 
      This means that an average cannot be used as a measure 
      of central tendency. The median is often used to 
      overcome this limitation.

### Interval data
- Interval data refers to the type of data that is based on 
  numerical scales which include equal units of precisely 
  defined size.
- Althogh similar to ordinal data, the key difference is that
  the invervals (or differences) between values are equal
  and consistent in measurement.
- This makes interval data more objective and scientific 
  because the spacing between values is meaningful and 
  uniform.
- Interval data categorises, ranks or infers equal intervals 
  between neighbouring data points, but there is no true 0.
- Examples of interval data include:
    - Test scores
    - Temperature

- Strength:
    - Interval level data is considered more informative than
      the nominal and ordinal levels of measurement. The gaps
      in between the scores are of equal value/distance and
      are therefore more reliable.

- Limitation:
    - In some instances, the intervals are arbitrary.


# Exam questions
1. Nominal

2. Nominal data is data that's in the form of categories.

3. Giving an opinion about something out of 10.

4. Interval data is often considered the most reliable because
   it's based on numerical scales which include equal units 
   of precisely defined size.

5. Levels of measurement are the different ways that variables
   can be measured. In psychological research, the level of 
   measurement used can impact the validity and reliability
   of the study.

# Statistical testing and sign test
- Statistical tests are used to determine whether the result
  of an experiment is significant, statistically speaking.
- It shows whether differences or relationships between
  variables found during experiments are statistically
  significant or if they have only occured due to chance.
- These tests use a probability level (level of significance) 
  set by the researcher. Usually in psychology this will be
  5% as this is generally thought to be acceptable.
- This meanst that, having done the statistical test, there
  is only a 5% probability that the results occured to to 
  chance factors, so the result is highly likely to have 
  happened due to the IV.

- In some cases, if researching a sensitive topic, researchers
  may use a more 'strict' level of measurement (for example 
  1%), to be even more sure that the results are significant.
  This may be used on drug trials, for instance.
- In a statistical test, the calculation is done, and the 
  result of the test is known as the calculated (or 
  obeserved) value. This is then compared with a table of 
  critical values.
- The calculated value must be greater than or lower than 
  (depending on the test) the critical value for the result
  to be significant.
- To find out what critical value is to be used, the 
  researcher needs to know the probability level, the number
  of participants, and whether the hypothesis was one-tailed 
  (directional) or two-tailed (non-directional).

# The sign test
- This test is used when investigating a difference (not an
  association), using a repeated measures design and the data
  are nominal.

- Step 1: Record the data and work out the sign.
    - For example, the sign will be negative if the value has
      decreased in the second condition but a positive if it
      has increased. If the value had stayed the same, this 
      value will be ignored and the N adjusted to exclude it.

- Step 2: Find the calculated value of the sign test, S, 
  which is the number of times the less frequent sign occurs.
  (Add up the +S and the -S and the select the smaller value)

- Step 3: Calculate the value of N (N is the total number of
  scores, minus any nil scores).

- Step 4: Is the hypothesis directional or non-directional?

- Step 5: Find the critical value of S - use the calculated 
  N value (which is the total number of values with the 
  ignored values excluded) and p<= 0.05 which means there is 
  less than 5% propability that the results occured by 
  chance. Use the critical values table which will be 
  provided.

# Critical values
- The critical value depending on the inferential test used, 
  as each test has its specific table of critical values. To
  identify the correct critical value for a study, several
  key factors must be considered:
    - Firstly, determine whether the investigation used a 
      one-tailed test (based on a directional hypothesis) or
      a two-tailed test (based on a non-directional 
      hypothesis).
    - Secondly, determine the number of participants (or 
      pairs of scores) in the sample.
    - Finally, choose an appropriate significance level 
      (e.g. 0.05).

# Hypothesis
- Before analysing data, a clear hypothesis must be outlined.
  This hypothesis can be either directional or 
  non-directional, and it's essential to identify which type
  is being used. Choosing the wrong hypothesis type may lead
  to selecting an inappropriate statistical test, which could 
  misrepresent findings.
    - A directional hypothesis states the expected direction
      of the results.
    - A non-directional hypothesis is used when there is 
      limited or conflicing evidence in the research area,
      and the researcher does not have a clear prediction 
      about the outcome.

# Significance level
- The level of significance, also known as the p-value, must
  be selected. This is the probability level (commonly p <= 
  0.05) used to decide whether the results are statistically
  significant.
- This refers to how much confidence we can have in the 
  research findings.

# Type I and type II errors.
- The choice of significance level is important in research; 
  however, the following errors in research can occur.

- Type I error:
    - A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is 
      rejected and the experimental/alternative hypothesis
      is accepted, even though the null hypothesis is actually
      true.
    - In this case, the researcher wrongly concludes that
      the results are statistically significant when they are
      not.

- Type II error:
    - A type 2 error occurs when the null hyopthesis is 
      accepted and the experimental hypothesis is rejected,
      even though the alternative hypothesis is true.
    - This is reffered to as a false negative, where 
      the psychologist believes there is no significant 
      effect when in fact there is.
