## Biopsychology:

# Nervous systems:
Central Nervous system:
This is the brains primary internal communication system, made up of cells. It responds to environmnetal stimuli and coordinates the 
work of the body's various organs and cells.
There are two sub-systems:
  Central nervous system (CNS) - Consisting of the brain and spinal cord
  Peripheral nervous system (PNS) - Responsible for transmitting messages to and from the CNS through neurons (nerve cells).

CNS communicates with the rest of the body.
Spinal cord: Long, thin, collection of nerve cells attached to the base of the brain.

Nerves - Cable like, individual fibres. Nerves attached to different areas.

Peripheral nervous system:

Somatic nervous system:
  The somatic nervous system facilitates communication between the CNS and the outside world.
  It is made up of sensory receptor that carry information to the spinal cord and brain, and motor pathways that allow the brain to 
  control movement.

  Sensory nervous system:
    
  Motor nervous system:
  

Autonomic nervous system:
  The autonomic nervous system play an important role in homeostasis, which maintains internal processes like body temperature, heart 
  rate and blood pressure.
  The autonomic nervous system only consists of motor pathways and has two components.
  
  Sympathetic division:
    The sympathetic nervous system is typically involved in responses that prepare the body for fight or flight.
    Impulses travel from the sympathetic nervous system to organs in the body to help us prepare for action when we are faced with a
    dangerous situation.
    For example, our heart rate, blood pressure and breathing rate increase, while less important functions like digestion, salivation
    and the desire to urinate are suppressed.
    
    Gray (1988) suggests that the first response to danger is to avoid confrontation altogether, which is demonstrated by a freeze response.
    During the freeze response, animals and humans are hyper-vigilant, while they appraise the situation to decide the best course of 
    action for that particular threat.
    (Freeze => fight or flight)

    Furthermore, the fight or flight response may be counterintuitive for women, as running (flight) might be seen as a sign of weakness,
    and may put their offspring at risk of danger.
    Tend or Befriend:
      Tend: Protection of their offspring or children.
      Befriend: For an alliance with others rather than running away.

    While the fof response may have been a usefull survival mechanisms for our ancestors who faced genuinely life-threatening situations
    (e.g. from predators), modern day life life rarely requires such an intense biological response.
    Furthermore the stressors of modern day life can repeatedly activate the fof response, which can have a negative consequence on our
    health.
    For example, humans who face a lot of stress and continually activate the sympathetic nervous system, continually increase their blood
    pressure which can cause damage to their blood vessels and heart disease.
    This suggests that the fof response is a maladaptive response in modern-day life.

  Parasympathetic:
    The role of the parasympathetic nervous system is to relax the body and return us to our 'normal' resting state.
    Consequently, the parasympathetic nervous system slows down our heart rate and breathing rate and reduces our blood pressure. 
    Furthermore, any functions that were previously slowed down during a fight or flight reaction are started again (e.g. digestion)

    task - sympathetic, sympathetic, sympathetic, sympathetic, parasympathetic, parasympathetic


  Use your knowledge of the autonomic nervous system to explain Billy's behaviour before and after the presentation (4 marks):

  The autonomic nervous system is responsible for maintaining homeostasis, heart rate, blood pressure, and other internal processes. Before
  his presentation, Billy's behavour indicates that the sympathetic nervous system has been activated because of he felt his mouth drying,
  alongside sweating. The sympathetic system is responsible for preparing us for danger - in this case, talking infront of the class is 
  percieved to be danger. After the presentation, he began to feel his breathing slow down, and he became thirsty, showing that the 
  parasympathetic system is involved, and his body is return to its 'normal' resting state.


# The endocrine system:
  The endocrine system instructs various glands (for example, the thyroid) gland to release various hormones which travel the body. Hormones 
  are chemical messengers which travel to particular organs and have powerful effects.
  The endocrine system and the ANS often work together.

  - The pituary gland is the most important gland, as it controls the release of hormones from other glands in the body.
  - Pineal gland - regulates the internal clock, produces melatonin and ...
  - Thyroxine, produced by the thyroid gland, has various effects, including increasing heart rate and raising metabolic rate.
  - Thymus - 
  - Adrenal - adrenaline
  - Pancreas - insulin
  - Ovary - estrogen and progesterone
  - Testes - testosterone

Both the endocrine system and the ANS work in parallel when an individual is faced with a stressfull situation.
This stressful situation signals the hypothamulus which activates the sympathetic nervous system.
This triggers the SAM (sympathetic + adrenal medula) pathway and the long term HPA (hypothamulus + pituary + adrenal cortex axis).

SAM pathway - The physiological connection between the sympathetic nervous system and the adrenal medulla and is curcial in an organisms 
psychological response to stessfull situations. It is often life-saving as it means an individual can react with speed when they come under
threat or they percieve that they are underthreat.
It is a process within the sympathetic branch of the ANS and the end result is the release or adrenaline, which aids the fof response.

HPA axis - A communication system between the hypothamulus, the anterior pituary, and the adrenal cortex. It directly influences the 
endocrine system to activate the stress response. When the brain interprets a stressor; the hypothamulus produces a hormone called CRF
(corticotropin releasing hormone), which stimulates the pituary gland to secrete ACTH (adrenocorti... hormone), which stimulates the adrenal cortex, part of the adrenal glands. The adrenal cortex then secretes cortisol which help to increase energy levels.

Oxytocin - Hormone related to bonding, love, childbirth and reproduction
Vasopressin - It increases the amount of solute-free water
ACTH - Stimulates the adrenal glands to produce cortisol steroids
Luterinising mornmones - Plays a role in fertility in both men and women, and triggering ovulation
Folice-stimulating hormones - Stimulates the growth and function of reproductive organs
Oestrogen - Cruicial for the development in female reproductive organs and function
Progesterone - Steroid hormone, plays vital role in the menstrual cycle, pregnancy and menopause
Testosterone - Primary male sex hormone, 
Cortisone - Used to treat inflamation
Cortisole - 
Corticosterone
Mineralocoriticoids
Adrenaline
Noradrenaline

Cortisol:
1) What gland is it located in - the adrenal gland (more specifically the adrenal cortex)
2) What is the function of that gland - It produces stress and steroid hormones
3) What effects does the hormone have on the body and behavious - It makes you feel stress, and it regulates how your body uses glucode 
   for energy, it decreases inflammation, regulates blood pressure, and helps control your sleep cylce.


# Neurons:
  Neurons are nerve cells which transmit messages chemically and electricity.
  Most are located in the brain (80%). There are three types:
    - Motor: Connects the CNS to muscles and glands
    - Sensory: Carry messages from the PNS to the CNS
    - Relay: Connect sensory neurons to motor and other relay neurons

A motor neuron is a neuron that allows for both volountary and involountary movements of the body through muscles and glands.

A sensory neuron (also known as a afferent neuron), are neurons that convert a specific type of stimulus, via their receptors, into action potentials or graded receptor potentials. This process is called sensory transduction.

Relay neurons are neurons that are not specifically motor or sensory neurons. They are also called interneurons. They are the central nodes 
of neural circuts, enabling connection between sensory or motor neurons and the CNS. They play vital roles in reflexes, and other things 
I don't know.


# Division of the brain:
starter: Central nervous system - spinal cord, brain
	 Peripheral nervous system:
	 	Autonomic nervous system - sympathetic, parasympathetic (responsible for fight or flight, and the calming down after)
	 	SNS - motor, sensory 

The central nervous system is responsible for connecting all the other nervous system together.
The peripheral nervous system is basically anything besides the CNS.
The autonomic nervous system is responsible for managing homeostasis, heart rate, blood pressure, along side other internal functions.

The brain is divided into two hemispheres. Generally, the left hemishpere is responsible for controlling the actions of the right-hand side
of the body, and the right hemisphere controls the left-hand side of the body.
Localisation of function in the brain examines the idea that specific parts of the brain serve functions such as language, memory or even 
hearing.

Frontal lobe - Manages thinking, feeling (emotions), your personality, self control and muscle control, memory storage and more.
Parietal lobe - It processes your taste and touch, and it helps with understanding where you are in relation to other things.
Temporal lobe - Hearing, memory, comprehension.
Occipital lobe - Processes visual information.

Auditory cortex:
The audio centre is concerned with hearing. The brain has two auditory cortices located mostly in the temporal lobes, one in each hemisphere
of the brain.
Sound waves are converted into nerve impulses.

Motor cortex:
The motor cortex is located in both hemispheres of the brain in the frontal lobe.

Somatosensory cortex:
Responsible for sensory and touch based experiences and is locate in the 

Primary motor cortex
Parabelt region
Supplementary motor area
Somatosensation
Proprioception

Broca and Wernickes area

The claim that functions are localised to certain areas of the brain has been criticised. Lashley proposed the equipotentionally theory, 
which suggests that the basic motor and sensory functions are localised but that higher mental functions are not. 

There is a wealth of case studies on patients with damage to Broca's and Wenicke's areas have demostrated their functions.


# Plasticity:



# Study of the brain:
- fMRI
- EEGs
- ERPs
- Port-mortem examination

Functional magnetic resonance imagining (fMRI):
It's a brain scanning technique that measures blood flow in the 
brain when a person performs a task. It works on the premise that
neurons in the brain that are the most active during a task use
the most energy and energy requires glucose and oxygen.
Deoxiginated haemoglobin has a different magnetic quality, and an
fMRI can detect these different magnetic qualities and create
a dynamic 3D map of the brain, highlighting areas involved in 
different neural activities.

Evaluation:
Non-invasive:
fMRI does not use radiation or involve inserting instruments 
directly into the brain, so it's virtually risk free.

Spacial resolution:
fMRI scans have good spacial resolution. Spacial resolution refers
to the smallest feature that a scanner can detect.

Temporal resolution:
fMRI scans have poor temporal resolution. Temporal resolution
refers to the accuracy of the scanner in relation of time, or how
quickly the scanner can detect changes in brain activity.
Causation:
Scans do not provide a direct measure of neural activity, fMRI
scans simply measure changes in blood flow and therefore it is 
impossible to infer causation (at a neural level).

EEG:
An Electrocephalogram works on the premise that information is 
processed in the brain as electrucal activity in the form of action
potentials or nerve impulses, transmitted along neurons.
EEG scanners measure this electical activity through electrodes
attached to the scalp. Small electrical charges detected by the 
electrodes are graphed over a period of time, indicating the level
of activity in the brain.

There are four types of EEG patterns including:
- Alpha waves - Rhythms with a frequency of 8-13Hz, typically 
  Occuring in a relaxed, alert, and calm state, often when the
  eyes are closed.
- Beta waves - Activity with frequencies of 12 to 30Hz, typically
  observed when a person is awake and alert.
- Theta waves - Slow, rhthmic patterns with frequencies between
  4-8Hz, dominant during sleep, deep relaxation, and states of 
  hightened creativity.
- Delta waves - High amplitude, with a frequency between 0.5 and 
  4Hz. Occurs in the deepest of sleep.

Each of these patterns has two basic properties that psychologists
can examine:
- Amplitude - The intensity and size of the activity
- Frequency - The speed or quantity of the activity

ERP:
An event-related potential is the measured brain response that is
the direct result of a specific sensory, cognitive, or motor event.
It is a stereotyped electrophysiological response to a stimulus.

ERPs are measured by means of electroncephalography (EEG). 

ERPs can be reliably measured using EEG, a procedure that measures
electrical activity of the brain over time using electrodes placed
on the scalp. The EEG reflects thousands of simultaneously ongoing
brain procesess. 

Evaluation:
Invasiveness, unlike microelectrodes, which require an electrode 
to be inserted into the brain, and PET scans that expose humans
to radiation, ERPs use EEG, a non-invasive procedure.

Spacial and temporal resolution:
ERPs provide excellent temporal resolution - as the speed of the 
ERP recording is only constrained by the sampling rate the
recording equipment can feasibly support.

Cost:
ERP research is much cheaper to do that other imaging techniques.
This is because purchasing an maintaining an EEG system is less 
expensive than other systems.

Biological rythms:

Biological rhythms are cyclical patterns within biological systems that have evolved in response to environmental influences e.g. day 
and night.
They regulate physiological functions, behaviours, and physical changes in response to both internal and environmental cues.
These natural cycles allow organisms to adapt and thrive by synchronising their activities with predictable changes, such as the daily 
cycle of light and darkness or seasonal shifts.

Circadian rhythms:
  A biological rhythm that cycles every 24 hours is called the 
  circadian rhythm.
  The sleep-wake cycle us an example of a circadian rhythm, which
  dictates when humans and animals should be asleep or awake.
  Sleeping and wakefulness are not determined by the circadian 
  rhythm alone, but also by homeostasis. 
  When an individual has been awake for a long time, homeostasis 
  tells the body there is a need for sleep because of energy 
  consumption.

  Hormone production also follows a circadian rhythm with cortisol
  at its lowest around midnight and peaking at 6am.
  Cortisol plays a role in making us alert and explains why if
  awaken at 4am we struggle to think clearly.

  Melatonin and growth hormones also have a circadian rhythm with
  both peaking at midnight,

  Body temperature is another circadian rhythm. Human body 
  temperature is at its lowest in the early hours of the morning
  (36C at 4:30pm) and at its highest in the early morning (38C at
  6pm).

  Siffre (1975):
    The aim of the study was to see how the circadian rhythm changes 
    with the absense of sunlight and environmental cues.
    Longitudinal case study - he was the participant.
    Spent 6 months in a cave.
    When he emerged from the underground, he believed the date was 
    a month earlier.

    Limitations:
      - Siffre's study included one participant: himself.
      - The results can't be generalised to anyone else; he may have
        lost objectivity.
      - Siffre and other participants in circadian rhythm research
        didn't exist in total darkness - they had artificial light
        throught the procedure.

  Subsequence research has supported the idea that the sleep-wake
  cycle has 24 hours, and any interferance to it may cause 
  detrimental effects.

  Folklard (1980) implemented a 22 hour sleep wake cycle and found
  that participants had experienced problems with short term
  memory and recall.

  However, it's important to note differences between individuals
  when it comes to circadian rhythms.

  Duffy et al. (2001) found that 'morning people' prefer to rise 
  and go to bed early (6am-10pm) whereas 'evening people' prefer to 
  wake and go to bed later (10am-1am).
  
  Buhr et al. (2010) found that fluctuations in temperature set 
  the timing of cells in the body and caused tissues and organs 
  to become active or inactive.

  Endogenous pacemaker - the bodies internal biological clocks
  Exogenous zeitgebers - external cues, including light,
    that help regulate the internal biological clocks.

  Endogenous pacemakers are internal mechanisms that govern 
  biological rhythms, in particular the circadian sleep-wake cycle.
  Although endogenous pacemakers are internal biological clocks,
  they can be altered and affected by the environment. 
  The most important endogenous pacemaker is the supriachiasmatic
  nucleus (SCN), which is closely linked to the pineal gland,
  both of which are influencial in maintaining the circaidan 
  sleep-wake-cycle

  The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), which lies in the hypothalamus
  is the main endogenous pacemaker (or master clock). It controls
  other biological rhythms, as it links to other areas of the
  brain responsible for sleep and arousal.
  The SCN also recieves information about light levels from the 
  optic nerve, which sets the circadian rhthym so that it is in 
  synchronisation with the outside world (day or night).
  The SCN sends signals to the pineal gland, which leads to an 
  increase in the production of melatonin at night, helping to
  induce sleep. The SCN and pineal glands work together as 
  endogenous pacemakers; however, their activity is responsive to 
  the external cue of light.

  Exogenous zeitbergers influence biological rhythms: these can be 
  described as environmental events that are responsible for
  resetting the biological clock of an organism.
  They can include social cues such as mealtimes and social 
  activities, but the most important zeitgeber is light, which is
  responsible for resetting the body clock each day, keeping it 
  on a 24-hour cycle.
  The SCN contains receptors that are sensetive to light and this
  external cue is used to synchronise the body's internal organs
  and glands. Melanopsin, which is a protein the the eye, it is
  sensetive to light and carries the signals to the SCN to set the
  24-hour daily body cycle.
  In addition, social cues, such as mealtimes, can also act as 
  zeitgebers and humans can compensate for the lack of natural
  light, by using social cues instead.

  Evaluation:
    The importance of the SCN has been demonstrated in research. 
    Morgan (1955) bred hamsters so that they had circadian rhythms
    of 20 hours rather than 24.
    SCN neurons from these adnormal hamsters were transplanted 
    into the brains of normal hamsters, which subsequently 
    displayed the same abnormal circaidan rhythm of 20 hours,
    showing that the transplanted SCN had imposed its pattern onto
    the hamsters.
    This research demonstrates the significance of the SCN and how
    endogenous pacemakers are important for biological circadian
    rhythms.
    However, this research is flawed because of its use of 
    hamsters.
    Humans would respond very differently to manipulations to their
    biological rhythms, not only because we are different 
    biologically, but also because of the vast differences between
    environmental contexts. This makes research carries out on
    other animals unable to explain the role of endogenous 
    pacemakers in the biological processes of humans.

    There is research support for the role of melanopsin.
    Skene and Adrendt (2007) claimed that the majority of blind
    people who still have some light perception have normal 
    circadian rhythms whereas those without any light perception
    show abnormal circadian rhythms.
    This demonstrates the importance of exogenous zeitgebers as a
    biological mechanism and their impact on biological circadian 
    rhythms.
    There is further research support for the role of exogenous 
    zeitbergers. When Siffre returned from an underground stay with
    no clocks or light, he believed the date to be a month earlier
    that it was.
    This suggests that his 24-hour sleep-wake cycle was increased
    by the lack of external cues, making him believe one day was
    longer than it was. This highlights the impact of external
    factors on bodily rhythms.

    Despite all the research support for the role of endogenos 
    pacemakers and exogenous zeitgebers, the argument could still
    be considered biologically reductionist.
    For example, the behaviourist apporach would suggest that
    bodily rhythms are influences by other people and social norms
    i.e. sleep occurs when its dark because that it the social norm
    and it wouldn't be socially acceptable for a person to conduct 
    their daily routines during the night.

The circadian rhythm is a biological rhythm that starts and ends
every 24 hours. One example of the circadian rhythm is the 
sleep-wake cycle, where people, and (not all) animals wake up in 
the morning to sunlight and change in body temperature with energy
which slowly depletes throught the day. When it's dark, you can go
to sleep when tired, before starting the next day.

Sam is having trouble sleeping during the day because her 
endogenous pacemarkers, which are the bodies internal biological
clocks, are struggling to actvate in the prescense of exogenous 
zeitbergers which are most optimal to Sams night shift. In this 
case, the exogenous zeitberger is the absense of light and change
in temperature which is required for sleep to properly occur.
The lack of alertness, tenseness and irritability come from the 
lack of sleep she is getting, and that is caused by her struggle 
to adapt to night shifts and day time sleeping.

Infradian rhythms:
  A rhythm that lasts longer than 24 hours, and can be weekly,
  monthly or annually.
  Some examples include; the menstrual cycle, seasonal affective
  depression, and hibernation.
  
  The female menstrual cycle is regulated by hormones that either
  promote ovulation or stimulate the uterus for fertilization.
  Oestrogen and progesterone are secreted by the ovaries and occurs
  monthly with the average timing being 28 days (although this can
  vary).
  Ovulation occurs roughly half-way through the cycle when 
  oestrogen levels are at their highest, and usually lasts for
  16-32 hours.
  After the ovulatory phase, progesterone levels increase in 
  preparation for the possible implantation of an embryo in the
  uterus.
  Originally, it was thought to be controlled by the hypothalamus 
  acting as an endogenous pacemaker, however evidence has shown 
  that exogenous zeitgebers play a part too.
  
  Folicular phase:
    A phase in which the follicles in the ovary mature. It ends 
    with ovulation. The main hormones controlling this stage are 
    follicle-stimulating hormones and luteinising hormones.

  Ovulation phase:
    A phase where egg cells are released from the ovaries. This
    typically occurs near the midpoint in the menstrual cycle and 
    after the folicular phase. Ovulation is stimulated by an 
    increase in luteinising hormone.

  Luteal phase:
    (15 - 28) The luteal phase is characterized by changes to 
    hormone levels, such as an increase in progesterone and 
    estrogen levels, decrease in luteinising hormone, changes to 
    the endometrial lining to promote implantation of the 
    fertilized egg, and development to the corpus leteum.

  Pre-menstrual and menstrual phase:
    (Day 1-5) The discharge of the egg and blood from the uterus 
    lining.


  SAD:
    A second example of an infradian rhythm is related to the 
    seasons.
    Research has found seasonal variation in mood, where some 
    people become depressed in the winter, which is known as 
    seasonal affective disorder (SAD).
    SAD is an infradian rhythm that is governed by a yearly cycle.
    Psychologists claim that melatonin, which is secreted by the
    pineal gland during the night, is partly responsible.
    Melatonin is produced primarily at night, so the lack of light
    during the winter months results in a longer period of
    melatonin secretion, which has been linked to the depressive
    symptoms.
    Infradian rhythms do not only occur monthly or by season, they 
    can apply to behaviours that occur once a year such as 
    hibernation.

  Evaluation of infradian rhythms:
    Research suggests that the menstrual cycle is, to some extent,
    governed by exogenous zetigebers.
    Reinberg (1967) examined a woman who spent 3 months in a cave
    with only a small lamp to provide light. Reinberg noted that 
    her menstrual cycle shortened from the usual 28 days to 25.7
    days.

    Russel et al (1980) found that female menstrual cycles 
    became synchronised with other females through odur exposure.
    In one study, sweat samples from one group of women were 
    rubbed onto the upper lip of another group. Despite the fact 
    that the two groups were seperate, their cycles synchronised.
    This suggests that the synchronisation of menstrual cycles
    can be affected by pheremones, which have an effect on people
    nearby rather than on the person producing them.

    These findings indicate that external factors must be taken
    into consideration when investigating infradian rhythms and
    that perhaps a more holistic approach should be taken, as
    opposed to a reductionist approach that considers only 
    endogenous influences.

    Evolutionaly psychologists claim that the synchronised 
    menstrual provides an evolutionary advantages for groups of 
    women, as the synchronisation of pregnancies means that 
    childcare can be shared among multiple mothers who have 
    children at the same time.

    There is research to suggest that infradian rhythms such as the
    menstrual cycle are also important regulators of behaviour.
    Penton-Volk et.al (1999) found that women expressed a 
    preference for feminised faces at teh least fertile stage of 
    their menstrual cycle, and for a more masculine face at their
    most fertile point.
    These findings indicate that worker's sexual behaviour is
    motivated by their infradian rhythms, highlighting the 
    importance of studying infradian rhythms in relation to 
    human behaviour.

    Finally, evidence supports the role fo melatonin in SAD.
    Terman (1988) found that the rate of SAD is more common in 
    Northern countries where the winter nights are longer.
    For example, Terman found that SAD affects roughly 10% of 
    people living in New Hampshire (a northern part of the US), 
    and only 2% of residents in southern Florida.
    These results suggest that SAD is in part affected by 
    exogenous zeitgebers that results in increased levels of 
    melatonin.

Explain the difference between circadian and infradian rhythms 
(2 marks):
The circadian is a rhythm that lasts for 24 fours. An example of 
the circadian rhythm is the sleep-wake cycle. The infradian 
rhythm is a rhythm that lasts longer than a day - it can take a 
week, month or year for each iteration. An example of the 
infradian rhythm is the menstrual cycle.

Ultradian rhythms:
  Ultradian rhythms last fewer than 24 hours but more than one
  hour.
  There are many different examples of ultradian rhythms including:
  - Bowel activity and urination,
  - Appetite
  One of the most important is the sleep cycle (do no confuse the 
  sleep-wake cycle, this cycle is only when someone is asleep).

  Sleep cycle:
  The sleep cycle alternates between REM (rapid eye movement) and
  NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep and consists of 5 stages.

  The cycle starts at light sleep, progressing to deep sleep,
  and then REM sleep, where brain waves sleep up and dreaming
  occurs. This repreats itself for 90 minutes through the night.

  A complete cycle goes through the 4 stages of NREM sleep, before
  entering REM (stage 5) and then repeating.

  Research using EEG has highlighted distinct brain waves patterns
  during the diffreent stages of sleep.

  Stages 1 and 2 are 'light sleep' stages. During these stages
  brainwave patterns become slower and more rhythmic, starting
  with alpha waves progress to theta waves.

  Stage 1:
    At this stage of sleep, it is easy to wake the sleeper, they're
    in light sleep. Slow and rhythmic alpha waves are the first 
    sign of sleep. These start to disappear and dare replaced by 
    low-voltage slow waves. Heart rate and tempertature declines 
    and muscles relax.

  Stage 2:
    A deeper state of sleep, but people can still be easily woken
    from. There are short bursts of sleep spindles. Theta waves 
    show that a person has gone into deeper sleep. Bodily functions
    slow down and blood pressure, metabolism and cardiac activity
    decrease.

  Stage 3 and 4 are 'deep sleep' or slow wave sleep stages, where
  it is difficult to wake someone up. This stage is associated with
  slower delta waves.

  Stage 3:
    Sleep is now becoming deeper than the first two stages. Sleep
    spindles decline and there are long slow delta waves with
    greater amplitude.

  Stage 4: 
    Deep sleep occurs where delta waves increase and metabolic rate
    is low. Growth hormones are released and this is where most 
    "repair work" is done. Sleepers spend about 40 minutes in 
    stage 4 sleep.

  Finally, Stage 5 is REM (or dream) sleep. Here the body is 
  paralysed (to stop the person acting out their dream).
  Brainwaves and activity resembles that of an awake person, with
  similar levels of energy of a brain that is awake.

  On average, the entire cycle repeats every 90 minutes and a 
  person can experience up to 5 full cycles in a night.
  A sleeper goes through stages 1-4 and then returns to 3, then 2
  before going to REM sleep - the cycle then starts again. 
  The total number of cycles depends on how long an individual 
  sleeps. The first four stages are NREM with only stage 5 being 
  REM, 70%-80% of sleeo is spent in NREM.

  Evaluation of Ultradian Rhythms:
  Individual differences:
    The problem with studying sleep cycles is the differences 
    observed in people, which make investigating patterns 
    difficult. 

    Tucker et.al. (2007) found significant differences between
    participants in terms of the duration of each stage, 
    particarly stages 3 and 4 (just before REM sleep). This 
    demonstrates that there may be innate individual diffrerences 
    in ultradian rhythms, which means that it is worth focusing on
    these differences during investigations into sleep cycles.

    In addition, this study was carried out in a controlled labs
    setting, which meant that the differences in sleep patterns
    could not be attributed to situational factors, but only to 
    biological differences between participants. While this study
    provide  convincing support for the rol of innate biological
    factors that may also play a role.

Outline and evaluate the effect of endogenous pacemakers and
exogenous zeitgebers on the sleep wake cycle (16 marks).

Plan:
Endogenous pacemakers - internal body clocks.
Exogenous zeitgebers - external cues (e.x. sunlight).

Sleep wake cycle - Circaidan rhythm, influenced by melatonin, 
temperature, sunlight.

The superchiasmatic nucleus which lies in the hypotahlamus is the
main endogenous pacemaker (master clock), it controls other 
biological rhythms and arousal.

Siffre et al (1975) - case study, cave, he lived in "darkness",
although he had artifical light. When he emerged from the 
cave, he believed the date was a month earlier.

Buhr et al (2010) found that fluctuations in temperature set 
the timing of cells in the body.

Folklard (1980) - he made participants sleep wake cycle 22 hours, 
and there were detrimental affects to their short term memory and 
recall.

Morgan (1955), hamsters who lived with a 20 hour sleep wake cycle
had their SNS transplanted to other hamsters, which then 
adopted the same cycle.
