## Research methods: Reliability and Validity

# Reliability
- Reliabilty is the measure of consistency. It is the extent 
  to which as test produces consistent findings.
- For example, if researchers are using a questionare to 
  prejudice, they want to ensure that the measure is
  consistent between participants and over time. If they test 
  someone today and found them prejudice, but upon retest the 
  following day they are not, then the questionare is 
  unreliable.

# Test-retest reliability
- In a test-retest, the same person or group of people are 
  asked to undertake the research measure, e.g. a questionare,
  on different occasions, with a reasonable time between
  attempts.
- The scores from each test are correlated.
- A positive correlation of at least 0.8 indicates 
  reliability. A perfect correlation is 1, so the closer this 
  the stronger the reliability of the measure.

- When using test-retest method, it is important to consider 
  than the same group of participants are being studied twice,
  so researchers need to be aware of potential demand 
  characteristics.
- For example, if the same measure is given twice in one day, 
  there is a strong chance that participants will be able to 
  recall the responses they gave in the first test, and so 
  psychologists could be testing their memory rather than the
  reliability of their measure.
- On the other hand, it is also important to make sure that 
  there is not too much time between each test.
- For example, if psychologists are testing a measure of 
  depression, and question the participants a year apart, it
  is possible that they may have recovered in that time, and
  so they give completely different answers.

# Inter-observer reliabillity
- Refers to the extent to which two or more observers are 
  observing and recording behaviour consistently. This is
  a particularly useful way of ensuring reliability in
  situations where there is a risk of subjectivity.
- Each researcher will record their results independently.
- Their scores will be correlated. A positive correlation of
  at least 0.8 indicates reliability.

- During the controlled observation of Ainsworth's strange
  situation, her research team were looking for instances
  of seperation anxiety, proximity seeking, exploration and
  stranger anxiety across the eight episodes of the 
  methedology.
- Ainsworth et al. (1978) found 94% agreement between 
  observers, and when inter-observer reliability is assumed
  to a high degree, such as this, the findings are considered
  more meaningful.

# Improving reliability:

## Questionares
- Adjust ambigious questions to avoid subjective 
  interpretation. For example, changing an open question to a 
  closed question. This heplps reducing possible responses and
  thereby limiting potential ambiguity.

## Interviews
- Use the same interviewer to reduce researcher bias. If the
  same interviewer cannot be used throught the interviewing
  process, then training should be provided to limit the
  potential bias.
- Changing the interview from unstructured to structured will 
  limit researcher bias.

## Experiments
- Lab experiments have high reliability due to high level of
  control over the IV, which in turn makes them easier to 
  replicate by following the standardised procedures. To 
  improve the reliability within experiments, researchers 
  might try to take more control over extraneous variables,
  helping them further the potential for them to become 
  confounding.

## Observations
- Operationalise the behaviour categories - this means that
  the categories need to be clear and specific on what
  constitutes the behviour in question.
- There should be no overlap between categories leaving no 
  need for personal interpretation of the meaning.


# Validity
- Validity refers to whether something is true or accurate.
  It's the extent to which a test is measuring what it is 
  supposed  to be measuring

- Internal validity is concerned with what goes on inside a
  study. It is the extent to which results are solely affected
  by changes in the variable being manipulated (IV) in a 
  cause and effect relationship.
- Did the IV really have an effect on the DV or was the DV
  caused by some other extraneous or confounding variable.

- External validity is the extent to which data can be 
  generalised to other situations outside of the research 
  environment. 
- There are 3 types of external validity.
    - Ecological validity,
    - Temporal validity,
    - Population validity.

## Ecological validity
- Ecological validity is the extent to which psychologists 
  can apply their findings to other settings, predominantly 
  to everyday life. 
- The following can be considered:
    - Is the situation representative of real life?
    - Are the consequences in research realistic?
    - Is the emotion expreiences by the participants realistic
      enough.

## Temporal validity
- Temporal validity is the extent to which research findings 
  can be applied across time.
- For example, Asch's research into conformity is often said
  to be lacking temporal validity because the study was a 
  'child of its time', that is, the findings were a product of
  the fact that the study was conducted in a conformist era, 
  and thus the findings may not be as applicable in today's 
  society.
- This is also refferd to as historical validity.

## Population validity
- Population validity refers to the extent to which the
  results of a study can be generalised from the sample used 
  in the study to the larger population from which that 
  sample was drawn.
- For example, the following can be considered:
    - Occupation,
    - Age, 
    - Culture,
    - Location, 
    - Gender.

# Research measuring validity
- Below are other types of validity:
    - Content validity
    - Construct validity
    - Criterion validity
    - Predictvie validity

- There are two ways of measuring validity:
    - Face validity
    - Concurrent validity

## Content validity 
- How well a test covers all aspects of the concept it's 
  designed to measure, ensuring it includes relevant items and
  excludes irrelevant ones to accurately reflect the whole
  subject.

## Construct validity
- How well a test accurately measures the abstract, 
  theoretical concept (construct) that it's supposed to 
  asses, ensuring that it captures the correct idea.

## Criterion validity
- Asses how well a test or measure correlates with an external
  standard to predict or reflect a specific outcome.

## Predictive validity
- The extent to which a test or assesments accurately 
  forecasts a future outcome.

## Face validity
- Face validity is whether the test appears to measure what 
  it says is measures.

## Concurrent validity
- This is where the performance of the test is compared to a
  test that it already recognised and trusted within the same
  field.

# Improving validity
## Experiments
- Use a control group
- Single-blind or double-blind procedures
- Use standardised instructions
## Interviews
- Use an unstructured interview with open-ended questions
- Assure interviews data will remain anonymous
## Questionares
- Use a lie scale
- Keep responses anonymous to avoid socially desirable 
  answers
## Observations
- Covert observations to reduce demand characteristics
- Use behavioural categories -clearly defined which don't
  overlap

responses anonymous to avoid socially desirable answers.
If peoples answers were publically available, they would
most defenitely lie in order to seem normal acording to 
social norms, making the data from the study not apply to 
real life.

# How would Janelle go about testing the reliability of her
# questionare? (3 Marks)
One way of testing the reliability of her questionare is to
use the test-retest method. Doing so will will show the 
consistency between participants answers. This would be 
conducted by giving the same participants the same test after
an appoipriate time, 

# In the context of any research method, explain the 
# difference between reliability and validity (4 marks).
Reliability is the measure of whether the result of a study 
is consistent across repeated tests. If someone was to score
high on a questionare one day, and low on another, assuming 
that the time differene was small, the test would be 
unreliable. Validity is the measure of whether the ideas and 
theories formulated through a study can apply to everyday life
and people.

# A psychologist conducted an experiment in which he 
# measured attachment behaviour in young children.
# Explain two ways in which he could have assesed the
# validity of this experiment. (4 marks)
One way of assessing the validity of this experiment is to 
see measure it's face validity. Face validity is whether a 
study appears to measure what it says it would measure. So in 
this case, if the experiment was to measure attachment 
behaviour in young children, but it didn't seem that way, it 
would be safe to assume that the study has validity problems.
Another way of assessing the validity of this experiment is 
to use concurrent validity. To use this measure of validity, 
you have to compare the study and it's findings compared to 
other trusted and recognised studies.
