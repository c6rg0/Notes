a. One reason why it was appropriate to conduct a correlation
   is because there are numerous factors that affect the 
   quality of sleep, such as diet and stress. It wouldn't have
   been possible to account for those factors, so a 
   correlation study would have fit best.

b. To use random sampling, the researcher first needs to have
   a list of students who are willing to participate. After 
   a list of students is complete, some method of 
   randomization - through software or a lottery style draw - 
   would then be utilized to get the sample group.

c. Spearman's rho correlation coefficient was a suitable test
  for the study because the tool is used to measure the 
  strength of a relationship between two variables when the 
  data is ordinal, which aligns with both the researcher's 
  hypothesis and the data type (rating on a scale of 1-5).

d. The appropriate critical value from the table is 0.472,
   because it's the value that lines up with the 0.05 level 
   of significance for a two-tailed test (non-directional 
   hypothesis) and N=18 since there was 18 participants in 
   the test.

e. The researcher's hypothesis shouldn't be accepted since 
   the calculated value of rho is 0.395, and the critical 
   value is 0.472. The calculated value of rho must be
   greater of equal to the critical value to be significant.

f. The use of 1% level of significance would have made the 
   sign test a lot more sensitive to the correlation between
   the 2 data sets produced by the study. This could have 
   potentially lead to a type I error.

g. A type II error is mistakingly failing to reject a false
   null hypothesis. In this context, there could have been
   a correlation between the amount of sleep and quality,
   but the findings wouldn't have represented a correlation.

a. A more appropriate statistical testfor the student to use 
   is the Wilcoxon test. This test is used for repeated design
   experiments which produce subjective ordinal data.
   One reason why the Wilcoxon test should be used instead of
   the unsigned t-test is because it tests for difference
   between related data sets - the pictures are related to
   each other - whereas the t-test is made for unrelated 
   designs. Another reason is that the unsigned t-test is 
   used for interval data - equal units of measurements - 
   which wouldn't make sense for the study which collects 
   subjective information.

b. The study could be improved by having another experimenter,
   who doesn't know the contents of the image show the 
   pictures to the children at random. Doing so would remove 
   experimenter effects.

# 3. 
Chi-squared is the statistical test that should be used 
because the study uses nominal data (frequency count of data
in categories). Another reason is that the studies use 
unrelated groups of people, so it couldn't have been the sign
test. Finally, the Chi-Squared is the test of association or
correlation, which the study also needs to use.

a. S = 2

b. Since the study had 10 pairs, N = 10, and had 2 equal 
   results across the teams sport and independent sport
   group, N becomes 8. Since 2 is higher than the level
   of significance (across 0.10, 0.05 and 0.01) which is 
   1, 0 and 0, it means that there was a significant 
   difference in the improvement of scores between the groups.
