# Briefly outline and evaluate one study of validity in 
# relation to diagnosis of schizophrenia. (4 marks)

One study of validity in relation to diagnosis of 
schizophrenia is the Rosenhan experiment (1973). The aim of
the study was to test the validity of psychiatric diagnoses.
Rosenhan himself, and 7 mentally healthy participants 
called 'pseudopatients' attempted to gain admission to
psychiatric hospitals by telephoning for an appointment
regarding auditory hallucinations. After an assessment, all
8 were admitted to a hospital - 7 being diagnosed with 
schizophrenia - and 1 with manic-depresive psychosis.
With these results, the validity of schizophrenia and 
medical diagnoses is questioned since an individual that's
free of psychopathology can get diagnosed and admitted.
A limitation of the study is that psychiatrists should not 
necessarily be expected to assume somebody is pretending to 
have a mental illness, causing a lack of realism. Also,
it didn't consider more realistic problems in diagnosis 
such as comorbidity with similar disorders.
