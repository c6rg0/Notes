Issues and debates in psychology:

Idiographic:
An approach that focuses on understanding 
individuals as unique beings by studying their specific 
experiences, traits and behaviours.
They favour qualitative research methods.
It does not seek to formulate laws or generalise results to 
others.

Evaluation:
The approach allows for a comprehensive, in-depth look at one 
individual, allowing for a full explanation of their behaviour.
Methods used by the idiographic approach are less 
scientiffically rigorous, so may be less valid. The approach
may be less useful as no general theories or predictions are
made. It's also time consuming to use.


Nomothetic:
Creating general laws and theories about human
behaviours by studying large groups, rather than focusing on
the individual.
This means that experiments, correlations, psychometric testing
and other quantitative methods are favoured among nomothetic 
researchers.
Experiments, structured observations and interviews involving
large groups of people are used to establish theories which
can be applied to everyone.
It provides a benchmark.

The nomothetic approach is the main approach within scientific
-ally oriented psychology. For example: Biological psychology,
Behaviourism, Cognitive psychology, Social psychology, Psycho
-pathology.

The nomothetic approach is less human-focused, as people are 
treated as statistics/sets of scores, rather than individuals
who have a range of influences on them.

Evaluation:
Rather than seeing the two approaches as distinctly different,
some argue they should be seen as complimentary of one 
another rather than contradictory.
Millon and Davis (1996) suggested research should begin with
the nomothetic approch and once generalisations, laws and 
trends have been identified, they could then shift the focus
onto a more idiographic undertanding.


What contribution did the case of the rat man bring to the 
psychodynamic approach?
The rat man was the second of six case histories that Freud 
published and the first in which he claimed that the patient
had been cured by psychoanalysis.

Explain how the researcher might develop the above 
investigation through taking a nomothetic approach [6 marks]:

To develop the investigation through taking a nomothetic
approach, there has to be a lot more structure implemented. 
The first step is to gather a lot more participants, at the 
moment the prison psychologist has a case study, and for it to
be nomothetic it has to be an experiment with a decent number 
of participants. The testing involved in the nomotethetic 
investigation should give quantitative results, so tests, 
questionares and structured interviews might have to be implem
-ented. The study shouldn't focus on understanding individual
experiences, but instead it should focus on finding a trend or
pattern that can be generalized.
(You have to include sampling; random sampling)
