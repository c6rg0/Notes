Social learning theory:
Emphasises the importance of observing and modelling behaviour and emotional reactions of others.
Bandura argued that there were both internal and external determinants of behaviour, 
and introduced the concept of reciprocal determinism.

Bobo doll experiment:
- Bandura, 1961
- Aim - to investifate whether young children observe and imitate role models

How we copy behaviour - ARMS:
- Attention
- Retain
- Motivation
- Skills

Rotter argued that the cause of human behaviours are much more ocmplicated than conditioning principles.
The key to predicting what we will do in a given situation depends on the behavioural potential - 
an expectancy to be rewarded and the value of the potential reward.
We form expectancies usually on the basis of past experiences of being rewarded.
Roter refers to these as locus of control.*

Internal LOC:
I control the consequences of my behaviour.

External LOC:
The consequences of my behaviour are outside my control.

Evaluation:
Advantages:
	- Scientific
	- Takes into account cognitive factors - thought processes which play a part in whether someone 
	  will copy a behaviour or not.
	- Explains a large number of behaviours - why people smoke for example.
	- Accurate and easy to understand and apply - e.g. interventions in both educational and offender settings.
	  If aggressive/negative behaviour can be learned via prosocial/positive behaviour, then it can also be learned
	  via social skills training.

Disadvantages:
	- Artificial settings
	- Demand characteristics? - children doing what they wanted experimenters to see.
	- Doesn't take into account genetic influences.
	- Also does not account for examples of children who grow up observing aggressive adult 
	  role models without in turn imitating that aggressive behaviour so to an extent it lacks explanatory power.

Issues and debates:
- SLT can be seen as supporting environmental determinism suggesting that aggression is learned from observing and
  imitating role models.
- SLT takes a nomothetic approach aiming to establish general law of behaviour for example all children learn 
  aggression through observation

Briefly explain what social learning theories mean by modelling in relation to gender development. Refer to the article 
above in you answer (2 marks):
When social learning theorists mention modelling in relation to gender development, they are discussing about how children
learn and copy the way that adults of the same gender behave. One example of modelling in relation to gender development
that can be found in the article is that a young girl might try on her mother's make up if she see's her mother do it.


Humanistic:
- The humanistic apporach deals with an individuals subjective experience, the way an individual sees the world and experienes it.
- It sees people as born "good", and suggests that a person can master their destiny, strive for growth, and 
  self realisation and is an active and dynamic being.
- Its focus is on personal responsibility, free will and an individuals strive for personal growth and fulfilment.

Person centered approach; Carl Rogers:
- The concept of 'self' is central importance to an understanding of human personality.
- Rogers felt that 'unconditional positive regard' is necessary for 'self-actualization'.
- The indvidual's central motivation is to learn and to grow.
- The whole person should be studied in their environmental context.
- Psychology should study the individual case (idiographic approach) rather than the average performance of groups (nomothetic).

- Rogers believed thaat people could only fulfil their potential for growth if they had a basically positive view of themselves 
  (positive self regard).
- This can only happen if they have the unconditional positive regard of others - if they feel that they are valued and respected
  without reservation by those around them.

Focus on the self:
1. Self-worth - this is self-esteem and concerns about what someone thinks about themself.
2. Self-image - this is how one sees themselves - either as a good person or a bad person.
3. Ideal self - the self concept an individual would most like to have.

-  Ideal self must be congruent/fit with their actions. Rogers highlights the importane of congruence which means a lack of conflict
   between an individuals perceived self and their experience and behaviours.
-  To help with this, at a young age, children should be give unconditional positive regard to promote healthy development.

Evaluation of Carl Rogers theory:
- Rogers was concerned with issues of major concern to people such as making their self concept resemble their ideal self more closley.
- Rogers humanistic approach led him to develop client centered or person centered therapy and even though this was proposed over 60
  years ago, it remains very influential in counsellling psychology.
- The humanisitc approach strongly influenced the dramatic rise of positive pschology.

Limitations:
- The theory greatly relied on phenomenology, which means that there was no exploration of unconscious process in detail.
- This approach and person-centered therapy emphasised the self and encourage self centeredness that played down 
  concerns for collective well-being.
- The entire humanistic approach is excessively optiistic at the risk of oversimplification it assumed by humanistic 
  psychologists that people are naturally good and so all they have to do is "to be true to themselves".

Maslows hierarchy of needs:
  (top)
- Self-actualization
- Esteem
- Love/belonging
- Safety/security
- Physiological
  (bottom)

Self-actualization - Getting the job you want, being able to afford a house
Esteem 		   - Getting good grades
Love and belogning - Self-explanatory
Safety 		   - Being safe, Shelter
Physiological 	   - Food, water, Sleep
