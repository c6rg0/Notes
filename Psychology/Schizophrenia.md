# Schizophrenia

- It is a serious psychological disorder characterised by severe distruptions in psychological functioning (thought, perception,
  emoition and behaviour) and a loss of contact with reality.
- People with schizophrenia struggle to distringuish reality from imagination which leads to hallucinations (auditory or visual),
  delusions (false beliefs), disorganised thinking and reduced emotional expression which often makes daily life a challenge.

## Classification
- Classification is the grouping of mental disorders on the basis of their characteristics or symptoms.
- All classification systems stem from the work of Emil Kraepelin (1883), who claimed that certain groups of symptoms occur
  together sufficiently often for them to be callled a 'disease' or syndrome.
- He suggested that each mental ilness is distrinct from others with its own origins, symptoms, course and outcomes; and 
  proposed that they fell into two categories - dementia proxia; and manic-depressive psychosis.

- His classification formed the basis of the DSM and the ICD published by the World Health Organisation.

1. Dementia proxia: Endogenous incurable ilness that beging early in life and leads to continuous deteriorating course with
   poor prognosis.
2. Manic depressive psychosis: An ilness with a cyclic course and a more favourable prognosis.


## DSM-5
- 2 of the following, with one having to be of the first 3.
    - Delusions fixed
    - Hallucinations
    - Disorganised thinking
    - Grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour
    - Negative symptoms (e.g. lack of motivation)

- Duration - 6 months with 1 month active phased symptoms.
- Impairment - Significant decline in major areas of functioning.

## ICD-10
- 1 of the following:
    - Thought echo, though insertion and withdrawal,
    - Delusions of control, influence or passivity,
    - Hallucinatory voices, giving a running commentary on the patient,
    - Persistent delusions that are culturally inappropriate
        - Or 2 of the symptoms must be observed for a period >= month.


## Types of schizophrenia
- Paranoid schizophrenia
- Hebephrenic schizophrenia or disorganised schizophrenia
- Catatonic schizophrenia
- Undifferentiated schizophrenia

## Positive symptoms
- Refers to an excess of usual funtioning; an added behaviour
  or experience. For example:
    - Hallucinations are additional sensory expreiences or
      disturbance in perceptions, such as hearing voices,
      seeing images in a distorted way. The most common is 
      auditory halluciantions, however, they can also include
      touch and smell.
    - Delusions are irrational beliefs, and also known as
      paranoia - these beliefs are firmly held despite them 
      being completely illogical, or there is no evidence for
      the belief.

- Delusion of grandeur: This is the idea that you are an 
  importnat individual, even god-like and have extraordinary
  powers.

- Delusions of persecution: The belie that others want to 
  harm, threaten or manipulate you.
  
- Delusion of control: Individuals may believe that they are
  under control of an alien force that has invaded their mind
  or body.

## Negative
- Refer to the loss of usual functioning.
- Avolitions is the reduction of goal-directed activity,
  manifested as a lack of motivation and drive, making it 
  difficult to go to work, maintain personal hygiene, or get
  out of bed. This is also known as apathy.

- Speech poverty ('alogia') refers to changes in speech 
  patterns, usually a reduction in the amount and quality of 
  speech. There is also a delay in a persons responses
  during conversations.
