# Schizophrenia

- It is a serious psychological disorder characterised by severe distruptions in psychological functioning (thought, perception,
  emoition and behaviour) and a loss of contact with reality.
- People with schizophrenia struggle to distringuish reality from imagination which leads to hallucinations (auditory or visual),
  delusions (false beliefs), disorganised thinking and reduced emotional expression which often makes daily life a challenge.

## Classification
- Classification is the grouping of mental disorders on the basis of their characteristics or symptoms.
- All classification systems stem from the work of Emil Kraepelin (1883), who claimed that certain groups of symptoms occur
  together sufficiently often for them to be callled a 'disease' or syndrome.
- He suggested that each mental ilness is distrinct from others with its own origins, symptoms, course and outcomes; and 
  proposed that they fell into two categories - dementia proxia; and manic-depressive psychosis.

- His classification formed the basis of the DSM and the ICD published by the World Health Organisation.

1. Dementia proxia: Endogenous incurable ilness that beging early in life and leads to continuous deteriorating course with
   poor prognosis.
2. Manic depressive psychosis: An ilness with a cyclic course and a more favourable prognosis.


## DSM-5
- 2 of the following, with one having to be of the first 3.
    - Delusions fixed
    - Hallucinations
    - Disorganised thinking
    - Grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour
    - Negative symptoms (e.g. lack of motivation)

- Duration - 6 months with 1 month active phased symptoms.
- Impairment - Significant decline in major areas of functioning.

## ICD-10
- 1 of the following:
    - Thought echo, though insertion and withdrawal,
    - Delusions of control, influence or passivity,
    - Hallucinatory voices, giving a running commentary on the patient,
    - Persistent delusions that are culturally inappropriate
        - Or 2 of the symptoms must be observed for a period >= month.


## Types of schizophrenia
- Paranoid schizophrenia
- Hebephrenic schizophrenia or disorganised schizophrenia
- Catatonic schizophrenia
- Undifferentiated schizophrenia

## Positive symptoms
- Refers to an excess of usual funtioning; an added behaviour
  or experience. For example:
    - Hallucinations are additional sensory expreiences or
      disturbance in perceptions, such as hearing voices,
      seeing images in a distorted way. The most common is 
      auditory halluciantions, however, they can also include
      touch and smell.
    - Delusions are irrational beliefs, and also known as
      paranoia - these beliefs are firmly held despite them 
      being completely illogical, or there is no evidence for
      the belief.

- Delusion of grandeur: This is the idea that you are an 
  importnat individual, even god-like and have extraordinary
  powers.

- Delusions of persecution: The belie that others want to 
  harm, threaten or manipulate you.
  
- Delusion of control: Individuals may believe that they are
  under control of an alien force that has invaded their mind
  or body.

## Negative
- Refer to the loss of usual functioning.
- Avolitions is the reduction of goal-directed activity,
  manifested as a lack of motivation and drive, making it 
  difficult to go to work, maintain personal hygiene, or get
  out of bed. This is also known as apathy.

- Speech poverty ('alogia') refers to changes in speech 
  patterns, usually a reduction in the amount and quality of 
  speech. There is also a delay in a persons responses
  during conversations.


# Using an example of each, explain the difference between 
# positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia (4 marks).

A positive symptom of schizophrenia is a symptom that adds 
a characteristic to the individuals behaviour. An example
of a positive symptom is hallucination, it's not impairing
the individuals ability but instead adding on.
A negative symptom of schizophrenia is a symptom which takes
away the ability to do something. An example of a negative
symptom is speech poverty, where a schizophrenics speech 
becomes less frequent and the quality of speech is worse 
than before.

# Issues with diagnosis and classification of schizophrenia

## Strength: Reliability
- Reliability
    - This refers to the consisteny of diagnosis.
- Inter-rater reliability is the extent to which different 
  assesors will arrive at the same conclusion when diagnosing
  the same patient.
- When the same assessor reaches the same diagnosis for the
  same individual on two occasions, this is test-retest 
  reliability.
- If schizophrenia is diagnosed inconsistently, this could be
  problematic, as it may be over or under-diagnosed by 
  psychiatrists, meaning patients will be incorrectly labbeled
  as 'schizophrenic', or not diagnosed, meaning they won't 
  recieve the treatment they need.

## Reliability and Validity
- Cheniaux et al (2009) found that inter-rater reliability 
 amongst two psychiatrists was low. One diagnosed 26 out of 
 100 patients with schizophrenia using the DSM, and 44 out of
 100 using the ICD.
- The other diagnosed 13 using the DSM and 24 using the ICD. 
  This supports that the classification and diagnosis of the 
  disorder is lacking in reliability and validity.

## Gender bias


# Biological explanations:

## Schizophrenia and genetics
- Family studies research individuals who have schizophrenia
  and determine whether their biological relatives are 
  similarly affected more often than non-biological relatives.
- The suggestion here is that schizophrenia runs in families
  and by studying family members and the occurance of
  schizophrenia, this can be investigated.
- Gottesman (1991) found that if a person has schizophrenia,
  there is a concordance rate with family, especially in
  identical twins.
- If a person has the disorder, there is a 48% chance that 
  their identical twin will also have it. The more genes
  the person shares with the sufferer, the more likely they
  are to have the disorder, suggesting there may be a 
  genetic basis for schizophrenia.

## Family and Genetics
- Gottesman (1991) demonstrated a positive correlation between
  the increasing genetic similarity of family members and 
  their increased risk of developing schizophrenia. The
  concordance rates are as follows:
    - Monozygotic twins (48%), dizygotic (17%), siblings (9%)
      and parents (6%).
- This particularly due to monozygotic twins sharing 100% of 
  their genes, strongly suggests a genetic basis and the
  existence of candidate genes for schizophrenia.
- However, it is important to note that there are no 100% 
  concordance rates, therefore demonstrating that there are 
  environmental influences acting on the development of SZ.

## Schizophrenia and Genetics
- Schizophrenia is thought to be polygenetic, with lots of 
  different genes contributing to an increased risk of 
  developing it.
- It is also aetiologically heterogenous, meaning different
  combinations of genes are implicated in the disorder.
- Ripke et al (2014) found 108 genetic variations associated 
  with schizophrenia.
- Schizophrenia is a multi-factorial trait as it is the result
  of multiple genes and environmental factors. This suggests
  that the research into gene mapping is oversimplistic as
  schizophrenia is not due to a single gene.

- Ripke et al (2013) conducted a genome-wide study of 5001
  cases of Swedish nationals with SZ and compared them to 
  6243 healthy controls.
- The researcher found "22 loci 4 associated at genome-wide
  significance; 13 of these are new, and 1 was previously
  implicated in bipolar disorder", alongside 8300 seperate
  candidate genes.
- Each candidate gene represents a genetic variation which
  marginally increases the risk of developing SZ.
- Therefore, SZ is a polygenetic disorder i.e has multiple,
  contributing candidate genes.

# Neural correlates of Schizophrenia
- Neural correlates are specific patterns of cortical activity
  or neural structures which coincide with specific 
  psychological symptoms, and so are assumed to contribute
  towards those symptoms.
- People with SZ have abnormally large ventricles in the 
  brain. Ventricles are fluid filled cavities (i.e holes) in
  the brain that supply nutrients and remove waste. This
  means that the brains of schizophrenics are lighter than 
  normal. The ventricles of a person with schizophrenia
  are on average about 15% bigger than normal (Torrey, 2002).

- There is growing evidence that schizophrenia is down to 
  abnormalities in the brain. The structure or functioning
  of the brain is correlated with positive or negative 
  symptoms.
- Negative symptoms: The ventral striatum is involved in 
  reward anticipation. Schizophrenia patients have been 
  found to have less activity in this region - the lower the
  activity, the more severe the negative symptoms. This 
  could explain avolition (loss of motivation).
- Positive symptoms: Allen et al (2007) scanned the brains
  of patients experiencing hallucinations whilst they
  completed an auditory processing task. Lower activation
  levels were found in the superior temporal gyprus and 
  anterior cingulate gyrus, and they made more errors, 
  compared to a control group. Auditory halluciantions are
  therefore correlated with reduced activity in these areas.

- Juckel et al (2006) suggested that abnormally low levels of 
  activation in the ventral striatum, when compared to 
  healthy neurotypical controls, may be associated with the
  negative symptom of avolition.
- This is because the ventral striatum is associated with 
  evaluating reward values, predictability and risks. 
  Therefore, low levels of activation and neurotransmission
  may mean that individuals cannot accurately assess the 
  reward of having enough motivation to carry out normal
  day-to-day tasks, and so are therefore unable to cope with
  'normal' life.
- Allen et al (2007) concluded that 'the mis-identification 
  of self-generated speech in patients with auditory 
  verbal hallucinations is associated with functional 
  abnormalities in the anterior cingulate and left temporal
  cortex, as SZ patients brain.

# The dopamine hypothesis
- Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, the levels of which seem to
  be associated with schizophrenia symptoms.
- Hyperdopaminergia: This regers to higher than usual levels
  of dopamine in the subcortex (central areas of the brain).
  This is linked with positive symptoms such as 
  hallucinations. There may be a higher number of dopamine
  receptors, causing over-activity of dopamine causing
  sensory hallucinations.
- Hypodopaminergia: This referes to lower than usual levels
  of dopamine in the cortex (outer part of the brain), where
  less dopamine is being transmitted across synapses.
  This is linked with negative symptoms, as there is a 
  reducing in normal functioning.

- The original hypothesis suggests that hypodopaminergia in
  the subcortex is responsible for SZ, whereas the revised
  dopamine hypothesis suggests that hypodopaminergia in the
  cortex is more likely to be more responsible for SZ.
  The mordern understanding is that both hyper and 
  hypodopaminergia in different areas of the brain 
  contribute to the development of SZ.

- Hyerdopaminergia in the fronal lobe, and specifically 
  Broca's area which may have an excess of D2 receptors, 
  may be responsible for the positive SZ symptom of auditory
  hallucinations, due to the overactivity of neurotransmission
  in the autditory areas of the brain.


## Genetics
Uses objective and clinical studies,
Support from studies that there is a significant genetic
impact,
Not a complete explanation, otherwise results for twin 
studies would be 100%,

## Neural correlates
Explains the psychical presentation of the genes associated
with SZ,



## Dopamine
Support with the success(?) of SZ medication,
Initial disagreement of how dopamine affects individuals with
SZ,

## Evaluation of genetics
- Tienari et al (2004) found that adopted children of 
  biological mothers with schizophrenia were more likely to 
  develop the disorder themeselves than adopted children of
  mothers without schizophrenia, supporting the genetic
  link.
- It may be that the increased concordance rates in the 
  Gottesman study were due to the increased chance of sharing
  the same environment as the person with schizophrenia.
