- Schizophrenia is a serious psychological disorder 
  characterised by severe distruptions in psychological 
  functioning thought, perception, emoition and behaviour) and
  a loss of contact with reality.
- People with schizophrenia struggle to distringuish reality 
  from magination which leads to hallucinations (auditory or 
  visual), delusions (false beliefs), disorganised thinking 
  and reduced emotional expression which often makes daily 
  life a challenge.

## Classification
- Classification is the grouping of mental disorders on the 
  basis of their characteristics or symptoms.
- All classification systems stem from the work of Emil 
  Kraepelin (1883), who claimed that certain groups of 
  symptoms occur together sufficiently often for them to be 
  callled a 'disease' or syndrome.
- He suggested that each mental ilness is distrinct from 
  others with its own origins, symptoms, course and outcomes;
  and proposed that they fell into two categories - dementia 
  proxia; and manic-depressive psychosis.

- His classification formed the basis of the DSM and the ICD published by the World Health Organisation.

1. Dementia proxia: Endogenous incurable ilness that beging early in life and leads to continuous deteriorating course with
   poor prognosis.
2. Manic depressive psychosis: An ilness with a cyclic course and a more favourable prognosis.


## DSM-5
- 2 of the following, with one having to be of the first 3.
    - Delusions fixed
    - Hallucinations
    - Disorganised thinking
    - Grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour
    - Negative symptoms (e.g. lack of motivation)

- Duration - 6 months with 1 month active phased symptoms.
- Impairment - Significant decline in major areas of functioning.

## ICD-10
- 1 of the following:
    - Thought echo, though insertion and withdrawal,
    - Delusions of control, influence or passivity,
    - Hallucinatory voices, giving a running commentary on the patient,
    - Persistent delusions that are culturally inappropriate
        - Or 2 of the symptoms must be observed for a period >= month.


## Types of schizophrenia
- Paranoid schizophrenia
- Hebephrenic schizophrenia or disorganised schizophrenia
- Catatonic schizophrenia
- Undifferentiated schizophrenia

## Positive symptoms
- Refers to an excess of usual funtioning; an added behaviour
  or experience. For example:
    - Hallucinations are additional sensory expreiences or
      disturbance in perceptions, such as hearing voices,
      seeing images in a distorted way. The most common is 
      auditory halluciantions, however, they can also include
      touch and smell.
    - Delusions are irrational beliefs, and also known as
      paranoia - these beliefs are firmly held despite them 
      being completely illogical, or there is no evidence for
      the belief.

- Delusion of grandeur: This is the idea that you are an 
  importnat individual, even god-like and have extraordinary
  powers.

- Delusions of persecution: The belie that others want to 
  harm, threaten or manipulate you.
  
- Delusion of control: Individuals may believe that they are
  under control of an alien force that has invaded their mind
  or body.

## Negative
- Refer to the loss of usual functioning.
- Avolitions is the reduction of goal-directed activity,
  manifested as a lack of motivation and drive, making it 
  difficult to go to work, maintain personal hygiene, or get
  out of bed. This is also known as apathy.

- Speech poverty ('alogia') refers to changes in speech 
  patterns, usually a reduction in the amount and quality of 
  speech. There is also a delay in a persons responses
  during conversations.


# Using an example of each, explain the difference between 
# positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia (4 marks).

A positive symptom of schizophrenia is a symptom that adds 
a characteristic to the individuals behaviour. An example
of a positive symptom is hallucination, it's not impairing
the individuals ability but instead adding on.
A negative symptom of schizophrenia is a symptom which takes
away the ability to do something. An example of a negative
symptom is speech poverty, where a schizophrenics speech 
becomes less frequent and the quality of speech is worse 
than before.

# Issues with diagnosis and classification of schizophrenia

## Strength: Reliability
- Reliability
    - This refers to the consisteny of diagnosis.
- Inter-rater reliability is the extent to which different 
  assesors will arrive at the same conclusion when diagnosing
  the same patient.
- When the same assessor reaches the same diagnosis for the
  same individual on two occasions, this is test-retest 
  reliability.
- If schizophrenia is diagnosed inconsistently, this could be
  problematic, as it may be over or under-diagnosed by 
  psychiatrists, meaning patients will be incorrectly labbeled
  as 'schizophrenic', or not diagnosed, meaning they won't 
  recieve the treatment they need.

## Reliability and Validity
- Cheniaux et al (2009) found that inter-rater reliability 
 amongst two psychiatrists was low. One diagnosed 26 out of 
 100 patients with schizophrenia using the DSM, and 44 out of
 100 using the ICD.
- The other diagnosed 13 using the DSM and 24 using the ICD. 
  This supports that the classification and diagnosis of the 
  disorder is lacking in reliability and validity.

## Gender bias

# Biological explanations:

## Schizophrenia and genetics
- Family studies research individuals who have schizophrenia
  and determine whether their biological relatives are 
  similarly affected more often than non-biological relatives.
- The suggestion here is that schizophrenia runs in families
  and by studying family members and the occurance of
  schizophrenia, this can be investigated.
- Gottesman (1991) found that if a person has schizophrenia,
  there is a concordance rate with family, especially in
  identical twins.
- If a person has the disorder, there is a 48% chance that 
  their identical twin will also have it. The more genes
  the person shares with the sufferer, the more likely they
  are to have the disorder, suggesting there may be a 
  genetic basis for schizophrenia.

## Family and Genetics
- Gottesman (1991) demonstrated a positive correlation between
  the increasing genetic similarity of family members and 
  their increased risk of developing schizophrenia. The
  concordance rates are as follows:
    - Monozygotic twins (48%), dizygotic (17%), siblings (9%)
      and parents (6%).
- This particularly due to monozygotic twins sharing 100% of 
  their genes, strongly suggests a genetic basis and the
  existence of candidate genes for schizophrenia.
- However, it is important to note that there are no 100% 
  concordance rates, therefore demonstrating that there are 
  environmental influences acting on the development of SZ.

## Schizophrenia and Genetics
- Schizophrenia is thought to be polygenetic, with lots of 
  different genes contributing to an increased risk of 
  developing it.
- It is also aetiologically heterogenous, meaning different
  combinations of genes are implicated in the disorder.
- Ripke et al (2014) found 108 genetic variations associated 
  with schizophrenia.
- Schizophrenia is a multi-factorial trait as it is the result
  of multiple genes and environmental factors. This suggests
  that the research into gene mapping is oversimplistic as
  schizophrenia is not due to a single gene.

- Ripke et al (2013) conducted a genome-wide study of 5001
  cases of Swedish nationals with SZ and compared them to 
  6243 healthy controls.
- The researcher found "22 loci 4 associated at genome-wide
  significance; 13 of these are new, and 1 was previously
  implicated in bipolar disorder", alongside 8300 seperate
  candidate genes.
- Each candidate gene represents a genetic variation which
  marginally increases the risk of developing SZ.
- Therefore, SZ is a polygenetic disorder i.e has multiple,
  contributing candidate genes.

# Neural correlates of Schizophrenia
- Neural correlates are specific patterns of cortical activity
  or neural structures which coincide with specific 
  psychological symptoms, and so are assumed to contribute
  towards those symptoms.
- People with SZ have abnormally large ventricles in the 
  brain. Ventricles are fluid filled cavities (i.e holes) in
  the brain that supply nutrients and remove waste. This
  means that the brains of schizophrenics are lighter than 
  normal. The ventricles of a person with schizophrenia
  are on average about 15% bigger than normal (Torrey, 2002).

- There is growing evidence that schizophrenia is down to 
  abnormalities in the brain. The structure or functioning
  of the brain is correlated with positive or negative 
  symptoms.
- Negative symptoms: The ventral striatum is involved in 
  reward anticipation. Schizophrenia patients have been 
  found to have less activity in this region - the lower the
  activity, the more severe the negative symptoms. This 
  could explain avolition (loss of motivation).
- Positive symptoms: Allen et al (2007) scanned the brains
  of patients experiencing hallucinations whilst they
  completed an auditory processing task. Lower activation
  levels were found in the superior temporal gyprus and 
  anterior cingulate gyrus, and they made more errors, 
  compared to a control group. Auditory halluciantions are
  therefore correlated with reduced activity in these areas.

- Juckel et al (2006) suggested that abnormally low levels of 
  activation in the ventral striatum, when compared to 
  healthy neurotypical controls, may be associated with the
  negative symptom of avolition.
- This is because the ventral striatum is associated with 
  evaluating reward values, predictability and risks. 
  Therefore, low levels of activation and neurotransmission
  may mean that individuals cannot accurately assess the 
  reward of having enough motivation to carry out normal
  day-to-day tasks, and so are therefore unable to cope with
  'normal' life.
- Allen et al (2007) concluded that 'the mis-identification 
  of self-generated speech in patients with auditory 
  verbal hallucinations is associated with functional 
  abnormalities in the anterior cingulate and left temporal
  cortex, as SZ patients brain.

# The dopamine hypothesis
- Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, the levels of which seem to
  be associated with schizophrenia symptoms.
- Hyperdopaminergia: This regers to higher than usual levels
  of dopamine in the subcortex (central areas of the brain).
  This is linked with positive symptoms such as 
  hallucinations. There may be a higher number of dopamine
  receptors, causing over-activity of dopamine causing
  sensory hallucinations.
- Hypodopaminergia: This referes to lower than usual levels
  of dopamine in the cortex (outer part of the brain), where
  less dopamine is being transmitted across synapses.
  This is linked with negative symptoms, as there is a 
  reducing in normal functioning.

- The original hypothesis suggests that hypodopaminergia in
  the subcortex is responsible for SZ, whereas the revised
  dopamine hypothesis suggests that hypodopaminergia in the
  cortex is more likely to be more responsible for SZ.
  The mordern understanding is that both hyper and 
  hypodopaminergia in different areas of the brain 
  contribute to the development of SZ.

- Hyerdopaminergia in the fronal lobe, and specifically 
  Broca's area which may have an excess of D2 receptors, 
  may be responsible for the positive SZ symptom of auditory
  hallucinations, due to the overactivity of neurotransmission
  in the autditory areas of the brain.

## Evaluation of genetics
- Tienari et al (2004) found that adopted children of 
  biological mothers with schizophrenia were more likely to 
  develop the disorder themeselves than adopted children of
  mothers without schizophrenia, supporting the genetic
  link.
- It may be that the increased concordance rates in the 
  Gottesman study were due to the increased chance of sharing
  the same environment as the person with schizophrenia.

## Evaluation of neural correlates
- The fact that there is a correlation between brain areas 
  and symptoms does not mean that the neural mechanism has 
  caused the symptoms. It may be that the difference in 
  activity levels could be a consequence of the disorder.
- Neural explanations have been criticised as reductionist,
  explaining schizophrenia at quite a simplisitic level of
  explanation. The role of upbringing, learning and empotions
  is not considered, weakenign this as a full explanation.

## Evaluation of dopamine
- Curran at al (2004) found that dopamine

#
# Treatment of schizophrenia

## Biological treatment
- Biological therapy is the most common treatment for
  schizophrenia. It was not until the discovery of dopamine
  in 1952 that drugs were developed to treat the effects of
  this neurotransmitter.
- Prior to this, patients with SZ were either placed in 
  straitjackets and locked up in institutions or recieved
  lobotomies or even ECT.
- Some of the drugs were found to create symptoms drugs such
  as amphetamines, while others reduced symptoms. The drugs
  that reduced symptoms are known as antipsychotics and
  they were used in drug therapy.

- Typical antipsychotics are first generation drug treatment,
  and primarily block dopamine receptors.
- They were good for treating positive symptoms, but at the
  higher risk of movement disorders.

- Atypical antipsychotics (second-generation) reduce the risk 
  of movement disorders at the expense of metabolic side 
  effects (weight gain, changes in appetite etc).

## Typical Antipsychotics
- Typical antipsychotics are first generation of antipsychotic
  drug therapy.
- Developed in the 1950s, they are known for treating positive
  symptoms. Since the advent of atypical antipsychotics, they 
  have lost flavour, as they have side effects some patients
  consider too severe to continue treatment consistently.

- They work by affecting the dopamine receptors (D2) in the
  mesolimbic pathway in the brain primarily but also 
  affect the rest of the brain unintentionally.
- They are known as dopamine antagonists, as they block D2
  receptors and calm the dopamine system in the brain.

- Positive symptomsof SZ result from the increase subcortical
  dopamine release in the brain, possibly due to a defect
  in the cortical pathway through the nucleus accumbens 
  (Brisch et al 2014).
- By targeting the dopamine system in the brain and blocking
  the receptors, typical antipsychotics reduce the stimulation
  that would be cuased by any initial dopamine release.

## Example of Typical Antipsychotics
- Chlorpromazine:

- The effectiveness of the dopamine antagonists in reducing
  these symptoms led to the development of the dopamine
  hypothesis. 
- Kapur et al (2000) estimate that between 60% and 75% of D2
  receptors in teh mesolimbic pathway must be blocked for 
  these drugs to be effective.
- Unfortunately to do this, a similar number of D2 receptors
  in other areas of the brain must also be blocked, leading 
  to undesirable side effects. 

## Side effects
- Dryness of mouth
- Blurred vision and grogginessa
- Weigth gain
- Sleep problems (either insomia or somnolence)

- Because these side-effects are unpleasant, it's difficult 
  to keep patients on their medication once they're released
  from hospital.

## Atypical Antipsychotics
- Atypical antipsychotics are second-generation developed in
  the 1980s as a solution to the side effects of typical 
  antipsychotics.
- Atypical antipsychotics are dopamine antagonists but they
  may act as serotonin agonists.
- Atypical antipsychotics treat both the positive and 
  negative symptoms of schizophrenia.

- An example is Clozapine which is used when other drugs have
  failed, due to the risk of agranulocytosis (a potentially
  fatal blood condition).
- Clozapine acts in a similar way to Chlorpromazine but also
  acts on serotonin and glutamate receptors.
- The effect of this is, as well as reducing positive 
  symptoms, the reduction of depression and anxiety, and the 
  enhancement of mood.
- It is therefore prescribed when the patient is at risk of
  suicide.

- Clozapine not only targets dopamine and serotonin receptors
  but also affects glutamate systems in the brain, 
  particularly the NMDA receptor. This unique mechanism of
  action is thought to contribute to clozapine's superior
  efficacy in treating treatment-resistant schizophrenia.
- Risperldone is another atypical antipsychotic and is 
  designed to be as effective and Clozapine without the
  risky side-effects.

## Evaluations: Strengths
- There is a body of compelling research evidence which 
  suggests that antipsychotics are an effective treatment
  for schizophrenia.
- Drug therapy is supported by the dopamine hypothesis and
  lends support to the biological explanation of 
  schizophrenia. All antipsychotics affect neurotransmitters 
  in the brain to bring about changes in symptoms. When an 
  idea is backed up by a well-researched scientific theory, it
  has construct validity.
- Antipsychotics are most effective at treating patients with
  the most severe symptoms who may not be treatable using 
  non-drug therapies (Furakawa et al 2015).

## Evaluations: Limitations
- Patients with milder, less extreme forms of schizophrenia
  benefit less from taking antipsychotics and may addtionally
  experience adverse side effects.
- It is not clear as to how effective antipsychotics are in
  preventing relapses in patients who are in remission.
- Antipsychotic drugs are weakened by the fact that they have
  serious side-effects.
- For example, some patients on typical antipsychotics 
  develop tardive dyskinesia. Even after stopping the use 
  of the drug, this condition can persist.
- Other sie effects are potentially fatal, for example 
  agranulocytosis and neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS).
- Side effects are less severe where patients are taking a 
  reduced dose, as many do today, but this can reduce the 
  effectiveness of the drug as well. The severity of the 
  side-effects is a weakness as patients will be relucatant
  to take them or may even die as a result of the effect.

- Tardive dyskinesia: A neurological syndrome that involves
  involuntary movements.
- Agranulocytosis: Refers to having severely low neutrophil
  levels. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell.
- Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: High fever, confusion, 
  rigid muscles, variable blood-pressure, sweating and fast
  heart-rate. Complication may include muscle breakdown, 
  high blood potassium, kidney failure or seizures.

## Issues and Debates
- Drug therapies support a biological determinist view, as 
  they assume schizophrenia symtpoms are caused by neuro
  chemical imbalances. 
    - This can undermine the patient's sense of control
      over their condition and implies that behaviour is 
      driven by biology, not personal choice or cognitive 
      factors.
- Drug therapies take a biologically reductionist approach, 
  treating schizophrenia as purely a chemical imbalance:
    - They overlook important psychological and social factors
      (e.g., cogntivie dysfunction, family environment).
    - This limits the explanations holistic value and may 
      reduce long-term treatment success if non-biological 
      causes are left unaddressed.

## Research investigating drug therapy
- Marder and Meibach (1994) - Schizophrenic patients who took
  risperidone compared to haloperidol or a placebo showed 
  significant improvement in both positive and negative 
  symptoms.
- Geddes et al. (2000) conducted a review of research and 
  found that there is no real difference in terms of 
  effectiveness between first and second generation 
  antipsychotics: typical antipsychotics should be prescribed
  in the early stages of an episode of schizophrenia unless
  the patient has previously had side-effects which included
  disjoined movement, including muscle spasms.

## CBT
- While cognitive explanations aim to explain why the 
  symptoms occur, CBT focuses on changing maladaptive patterns
  and behaviours to improve the individual's quality of
  life.
- Essentially, cognitive explanations provide the 
  understanding, while CBT offers the treatment.
- With schizophrenia patients, they are encouraged to trace
  back the origins of their symptoms in order to get a better
  idea of how the symptoms might have developed.

- CBT in this case is tailored to address the specific 
  challenges posed by the condition, especially in relation
  to delusions and hallucinations. Through CBT, individuals
  learn to question the validity of their delusions and 
  develop coping strategies to manage hallucinations more
  effectively.
- They are also encouraged to evaluate the content of their 
  delusions or any internal voices they hear and to consider
  ways in which they might test the validity of their faulty
  beliefs.
- Therapists may use:
  - Logical (does it make sense?),
  - Empirical (where is the evidence?),
  - Pragmatic (how is this belief helpful?) disputing 
    techniques.

### Evaluation of CBT: Strenghts
- It is highly structured, collaborative, and typically short-
  term. The treatment is often prolem-oriented and 
  prescriptive. The short duration, typically 5-20 weeks also
  makes it attractive to insurance companies.

- Widely considered to be evidence-based, cost-effective 
  treatement that can be applied to various mental health
  disorders. It emphasises enhancing self-efficiacy.

### Limitations
- For patients with positive symptoms - paticularly if 
  unmedicated - collaboration between patient and practitioner
  may be unattainable, when it heavily depends on that 
  relationship.

- During acute psychotic episodes, where dopamine levels are
  eleveted, patients may struggle to respond to therapy due 
  to delusions, paranoia, and attention defecits.

- Many clinicians now recommend stabalising symptoms with 
  antipsychotic medicatoin before initiating CBT to ensure
  patients are lucid enough to engage meaningfully in 
  therapy.

- While some CBT studies have reported some benefit for 
  positive symptoms, its impact on negative symtpoms is 
  much less clear. Given that negative symptoms are often 
  more deliberating in the long term, this limitation reduces
  CBT's overall utility for many patients with schizophrenia.

- Some researchers suggest that CBT may only be effective 
  when patients are medicated.

## Family therapy
- Family therapy is based on the theory that schizophrenia is
  associated with schizophrenogenic mothers, double bind
  communication, expressed emotion, or other dysfunction in
  the family.
- The aim in modern forms of this therapy is to reduce the
  stress in the family environment so preventing relapse 
  and is aimed at all those involved: the patient themselves
  and their immediate family who have to cope with the
  ilness indirectly on a daily basis.
- The goal of family therapy sessions is to help family 
  members process their thoughts and feelings about the 
  ilness and come together to find practical, feasible 
  problem-solving solutions to the situation.

- Phearoah et al (2010) suggests that the following 
  techniques, in which all of the family are involved, are 
  used:
  - A co-operative, trusting relationship with the family is 
    established.
  - Therapist provides information about schizophrenia.
  - Family members contribute, all contributions valued.
  - Reducing anger and guilt which can effect all family
    members.
  - Family is provided with practical coping skills to help
    deal with the disorder (to anticipate and solve problems).
  - More constructive ways of communication encouraged (to
    avoid expressed emotion).
  - Traiding to detect any signgs of relapse in the patient.

### Research investigating family therapies
- Kart et al (2021) - A review article which concluded that
  CBT is an effective therapy, particularly in treating 
  symptoms of schizophrenia.
- Turkington et al (2006) found that CBT can be combined with
  family therapy to treat both positive and negative symptoms
  of schizophrenia and to generally improve outcomes for the 
  person with schizophrenia.
- Caquo-Urizar et al (2015) - A review article which 
  emphasises the vital role of family therapy in the face of
  cut-backs in mental health care facilities and which 
  stresses the need for health professionals to assist and
  guide family members in the care of the person with 
  schizophrenia.

## Evaluation for family therapy: Strengths
- Pharoah et al (2010) found that there is moderate evidence
  to show that family therapy reduces relapse rates and
  hospital readmissions in schizophrenia patients, but there
  were variances in the quality of research studies used.
  Therefore, there is (weak) researchers support for family
  therapy.
- Family therapies may improve the quality of life for 
  schizophrenia patients and their families, but do not 
  provide a cure for schizophrenia, rather a management of
  the effects. This means it cannot be used to treat 
  schizophrenia by itself.
- Family therapy is based on the premise that nurture is a 
  significant factor in schizophrenia. The biological basis
  for schizophrenia is therefore not addressed at all in the
  therapy, limiting its use.

## Limitations
- One critisism is that family therapy ptus significant 
  burden on the family members who may not be equipped to cope
  with the needs of schizophrenic sufferers.
- Specialist care and intervention may be better suited by 
  staff that better understand the symptoms and problems and 
  the use of family members may not be appropriate as this
  could then impact on their lives causing great stress as 
  they cope to manage another person's problems as well as
  their own.
- Another view is that the faily environment, while offering
  lower relapse rates may simply be masking the symptoms of 
  the sufferer as they have come to see them as a normal 
  part of their personality.

## Issues and debates
- Psychological therapies take a more holistic approach, 
  considering social, emotional, and cognitive aspects of
  schizophrenia rather than biology.

# Token economies

## Strenghts
- Token economies are found to be useful for patients whose 
  symptoms are mild as they mainly need motivation to enable
  them to cope with everyday challenges such as social 
  interaction and personal hygiene.
- Due to the set up of token economies, staff are required to
  give rewards immediately after the desirable behaviour
  is displayed. This in itself makes therapy more effective
  in hospital settings where staff can monitor patients
  around the clock. The therapy may be more appropriate only
  within the hospital settings where the behaviours of
  patients need to be controlled for reasons such as risk
  to staff or suicide.
- Token economies therefore facilitate a safer more 
  therapeutic environment and staff and patient injuries
  reduce with both having a more positive regard for one 
  another which is motivational for patients and staff.
- A programme of token economy behaviour is less potentially
  harmfull than drug therapy so it may be more ethically 
  valid to some extent.

## Limitations
- Token economies can only remain effective if tokens can be
  exchanged for a variety of rewards. If they remain the same,
  saliation occurs and the behaviour decreases in frequency.
  This is a reason why it may only be effective in managing
  behaviour in institutions because e.x. hospital settings
  can provide variety unlike the community.
- A token economy could be viewed as being patronising, 
  which means that there are ethical concerns about the 
  protection of patients who are enrolled in such a system.
  Some clinicians argue that participants are humilliated 
  into obeying for necessities which makes it an inappropriate
  treatment.
- Although helpful in helping staff manage patient behaviour,
  token economies alone merely mask the symptoms of
  schizophrenia with desirable behaviours making it 
  ineffective as the underlying cause is not tackled in
  anyway.

## Issues and debates: token economy
- Token economies operate on operant conditioning, 
  ecouraging specific behaviours through reinforcement, 
  which reflects environmental determinism.
  - This raises the question of whether patients are truly
    choosing their behaviour or simply responding to 
    rewards, limiting their autonomy and free will.
- Token economies are reductionist, focusing only on
  external behaviour change without addressing underlying
  cognitive, emotional, or biological causes of schizophrenia.
  - This limits their long-term effectiveness, as behaviour
    may not generalise outside of the institutional setting
    once reinforcement is removed.

# Interactionist approach
- The interactionist approach is holistic, biopsychosocial
  (biological + psychological + social) model proposing that
  the disorder develops from a combination of underlying
  vulnurability (diathesis) and environmental triggers 
  (stress).
- It merges biological factors with psychological and social
  factors.
- Most importantly, these factors do not simply add together
  but combine in a way that cannot be predicted by each one 
  seperately, i.e the interact.

## Risk factors
- Biological factors:
    - Genetic predisposition
    - Perinatal predisposition
    - Prenatal complications
    - Prenatal exposure to pathogens
    - Abnormal brain  structures
    - Neurochemical imbalances

- Environmental stressors:
  - Early childhood trauma
  - Family dysfunction
  - Substance abuse
  - Socioeconomic stressors
  - Urban living environments

- The original model simplifies genertic vulnurability, 
  treating it as fixed.
- It does not account for the complex interplay of epigenetic
  factors - where genes can be turned on or off by 
  environmental influences - or neuroplasticity, which 
  involves changes in brain structure and function over time.
- Additionally, the term "stress" is too broad and vague,
  failing to account for specific types of environmental
  factors that can activate genetic vulnurabilities.

## Interactionist theory
- The updated model recognises that genetic vulnurability
  is dynamic and subject to change based on environmental
  influences.
- The model incorporates research on epigenetics - the process
  by which environemtnal factors can switch genes on or off - 
  affecting how they are expressed.
- Rather than a simple vulnurability-stressor relationship,
  the updated model considers factors such as negative
  neuroplasticity, where harmful experiences lead to 
  detrimental changes in the brain's structure and function.

## Risk factors
- Biological risk factors include those that can affect gene
  expression during critical periods of brain development,
  such as:
  - Canabis use: According Di Forti et al. (2019) the use of
    canabis in adolescence can increase schizophrenia risk
    by affecting dopamine signaling through epigenetic 
    changes.
  - Prenatal infections: According to Brown and Patterson 
    (2011) maternal infections, such as influenza during the 
    3rd trimester, can disrupt foetal brain development. 
    These infections can induce epigenetic changes that affect
    cortical development.
  - Low vitamin D levels during pregnancy may also impact 
    foetal brain development, increasing schizophrenia risk.

- Psychological risk factors focus on trauma and stress:
  - Trauma and abuse: According to Read et al. (2005), 
    chronic childhood trauma, such as abuse, can lead to 
    lasting epigenetic changes in genes associated with the 
    stress response and brain development.
  - Chronic stress: Prolonged stress alters cortisol 
    regulation and can dysregulate brain regions like the 
    hippocampus, leading to negative plasticity and increased
    vulnurability to schizophrenia.

## Iinteractionist approach: Strengths
- The interactionist approach highlights the dynamic interplay
  between genetic predisposition and environmental influences
  in explaining schizophrenia. This approach emphasises
  the importance of addresing both biological and 
  environmental factors in treatment.
- For example, treatments should include antipsychotic

  - Could be seeen at patronising, which gives it ethical
    concerns (also, patients don't consent to it).
  - Less harmful than drug therapy, which has an array of 
    side effects, which can be severe (e.x. tardive 
    dyskinesia)

- Conclusion:
