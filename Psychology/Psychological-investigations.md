# Reporting psychological investigations
- When psychologists conduct research, they often want to 
  share their findings with the psychology community but if
  everyone wrote psychological reports in their own individual
  style would be difficult for the reader to navigate.

# Sections of a scientific report
- The sections of a scientific report are:
    - Abstract
    - Introduction
    - Method
    - Results
    - Discussion
    - References

# Abstract
- An abstract is the first section of a psychological report
  but it is written last.
- It is a summary of the key points of the research (roughly
  150-200 words).
- It is the first section that readers will encounter, and it
  should provide enough information to give a general overview
  of the study and allow the reader to make an informed 
  decision about whether to read the rest of the article or
  not.
- It will cover the aim, hypothesis, participants, methedology
  results, and conclusionis.
  
# Introduction
- It explains why the research is being conducted and 
  considers what has already been studied in past research.
- It contains a literature review that offers an overview
  of previous relevant studies, beginning with broad 
  concepts and graduallly narrowing to the specific resrarch
  area, formulation of the research aim, and hypotheses.

# Method
- It is typically split into several sections, reported in 
  sufficient detail so that the reader would be able to 
  replicate the study (if they wanted to):
    - Design
    - Sample/participants
    - Apparatus/materials
    - Procedure
    - Ethics
- The method and results section combined should account for 
  approximately a third of the overall report.

## Method: Design
- This section explains the technical details of the study's
  design without describing the full procedure.
- It should clearlly state the type of experimental design
  and the independent and dependent variables.
- For correlational studies, the co-variables and their 
  presentation order should be detailed. If multiple 
  condictions exist, each should have a clear, consistent
  name used throughout the report.
- Additionally, explain how participants were assigned to 
  conditions and any counterbalancing methods used.

## Method: Sample
- This section describes the participants and how they were
  selected (e.g. volunteer sampling).
- It includes the total number of participants and important
  demographic details such as mean age and other relevant 
  characteristics like educational level, depending on the
  study.

## Method: Materials
- This section details the equipment and materials used in 
  the study, such as computers for presenting stimuli or 
  questionares completedd by participants.
- Copies of questionares should be included in an appendix, 
  not here.
- If only simple itmes (e.g. pens, stopwatches) are used, 
  this section may be ommited.
- Complex apparatus setups can be explained with diagrams to
  clarify the procedure.

## Method: Procedure
- This section outlines the step-by-step procedure of the 
  study in the exact order it occured, allowing the reader
  to replicate it.
- It includes details on standardised instructions, informed
  consent, and debriefing.
- The descriptions should be clear and consise.

## Method: Ethics
- The final part of the method section addresses any ethical
  issues encountered in the study and how they were managed.
- For example, if deception was used, the resarch should 
  explain the informed consent challanged and how a 
  debriefing resolved them.

# Results
- The results section presents the study's findings, primarily
  through numerical data, graphs, and tables.
- Raw data should be excluded but can be added in an appendix.
- The section begins with how data was processed, followed by
  descriptive statistics (e.g. mean, percentages, SD), and 
  then inferential statistics to assess significance.
- The choice of statistical tests must be explained, with test
  values and p-values (to 3.d.p) reported.
- Results should be clearly linked to whether the hypothesis
  are supported or rejected.

# Discussion
- The discussion is where the findings are interpreted in 
  prose form and connected to the research questions, 
  hypotheses, and prior literature.

- It should:
    - Compare findings with the original aims and hypotheses
    - Relate findings to existing research
    - Discuss implications for future research
    - Acknowledge unexpected results and study limitations

- The section ends with a critical evaluation of the 
  researcher's impact on the field. This section typically
  forms the finaly third of the report.

# References
- Referencing gives credit to the original authors of works
  cited in a research report.
- References should be listed alpahbetically by the author's 
  last name and formatted accroding to APA style. Books and 
  journal articles have distinct formats:
    - Book: Author, Initial. (Year). Title in italaics.
            Location: Publisher.
    - Journal article: Author, Initial. (Year). Article title.
                       Journal Title in italics, volume 
                       (issue), page range.

# Outline three components that are typically included in
# the method section of a psychological research report.
One component that is typically included in the method 
section of a research report is design, which explains the 
technical details of the study's design without describing 
the full procedure. Another component of the method section 
is the sampling/participants. Finally, the materials that are 
used in the study - so that it can be replicated - are 
included in the method section.
