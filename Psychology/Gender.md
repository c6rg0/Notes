# Optional topic: Gender

# Sex and gender
- In psychology, sex is the classification of being male or
  female. 
- It is biologically determined - caused by 
  chromosomes and hormones.
- Therefore, different sexes will have different sex
  chrmosomes, genotypes (XX or XY), gene expression, hormone
  types and levels.
- It is fixed and cannot be changed, and is innate (due to 
  influence of nature only).

## Gender
- This is a social construt and allows individuals to identify
  themselves (self representation) as being either feminine 
  or masculine.
- It is influenced by psychological and social factors, the
  role of nature and nurture play a part, and is more fluid
  and open to change - this means it is more of a sliding
  scale, whereas sex tends to be a binary choice of male
  or female.
- This in turn influences behaviour, how people choose to 
  dress and also how they introduce themselves.
- Gender can be changed through gender reassignment surgery.

- Gender schema theory states that once children have 
  identified themselves as a girl or a boy, they are motivated
  to be like others in their gender group.
- This leads them to observe and imitate same-sex role models
  and conform to their sex-role expectations, which match 
  their gender schema.
- Sex and gender often align, but they do not cecessarily 
  have to.
- When there is a mismatch, it can cause distress and a
  feeling of being trapped in the 'wrong body', which is
  called gender dysphoria.

## Sex-role stereotypes
- Sex-role stereotypes are the result of social and cultural
  beliefs about what is normal for male and female behaviours.
- Societal expectations for boys and girls is different
  and children are taught these roles from a very early age.

## Sex and gender
- You cannot choose your sex, but you can choose your gender.
- With such differences between sex and gender comes 
  gender-identity disorder, which occurs when a person's
  sex is not in accordance with their gender.
- To resolve this, individuals may identify as being 
  transgender, and/or undergo gender transitioning. This 
  changes the person's sexual identity through changing 
  their reproductive organs and hormone levels.

- Many people view their sex and gender as being in accordance
  and this may have led to the development of sex-role
  stereotypes, which describes the expecations and 
  perceptions that individuals and society have as to what
  is appropriate behaviour for each sex.
- This leads to the development of stereotypes, as to how
  each gender should behave.
- Howver, this also results in 'justification' for
  discriminatory practices on the basis on sex, such as 
  denying women well-paid but potentially stressful work 
  opportunities in the fear that they will not be able to
  manage.

## Evaluation of sex and gender
- Strengths:
  - Sex-role stereotypes can differ substantially cross-
    culturally (Mead, 1935), suggesting that the 
    characteristics associated with sex-role stereotyping
    could be addressed by providing learning experiences for
    children that reinforce the idea of positive sex roles.
  - Research and day-to-day experience demonstrates that 
    sex-role stereotypes are reinforced by the media and so
    supports the theory that sex-role expectations are
    transmitted through sex-role stereotypes.

- Weaknesses:
  - Categorising behaviours, and qualities as either 
    masculine or feminine may restrict the positive roles
    that both males and females could play in society, like
    male child minders or female scientists.
  - However, it does not explain how individuals resist 
    being socialised into traditional sex roles.
  - Different stereotypes - there os unlikely to be a one-
    size-fits-all explanation of gender stereotypes, as 
    there are many different forms of stereotypes.

## Issues and debates
- The difference between sex and gender can be seen as an 
  example of the nature/nurture debate.
- While sex is determined from the moment of conception and
  at birth, gendder could be argued to be socially constructed
  through gender schemas composed of sex-role expectations.
- Biological psychologists argue that gender is innate,
  because, for example, women tend to be smaller and less 
  muscular than men, have higher-pictched voices etc.
- This sexual dimorphism is believed by psychologists of
  the biological approach to determine the psychological
  traits associated with each gender.

- Therefore, the biological approach argues that, in the
  same way that chromosomes and hormones determine an
  individual's sex, they also determine whether a person
  will behave in a more feminine or masculine way.
- However, if gender is determined by sex, this would mean
  that there would be none of the cross-cultural differences
  in masculine or feminine behaviour, identified by Mead 
  (1935) and others after her.
- Of course, nature and nurture interact and there is no 
  behaviour that can be exclusively one or the other, but sex
  owes more to nature and gender is created through sex-role
  stereotyping, which is more nature.

## Sex and temperament
- Margaret Mead (1935) conducted a classic study of cultural
  differences in Papua New Guinea.
- Her aim was to discover to what extent temperamental 
  differences between the sexes were culturally determined
  rather than innate.
- She examined 3 different tribes and found the:
  - Arapesh men and women to be gentle, responsive and 
    cooperative;
  - Mundugumur men and women were violent and aggressive,
    seeking power and position;
  - Tchambuli showed the opposite gender-role behaviours
    to those seen in most countries, as the women were 
    dominant, impersonal and managerial and the men were more
    emotionally dependent.
- Mead originally concluded that these differences highlight
  the impact of culture on gender.

## Androgyny
- This is the psychological state of possessing a balance of
  male and female psychological characteristics.
- It comes from the Greek 'Andro' meaning male, and 'gyny'
  meaning female describing an identity between masculine
  and feminine characteristics.
- For example, a man may possess the emotional skills to be
  caring, but also is competetive and ambitious. This is 
  thought to be advantageous, as the person can respond 
  appropriately to many different situations in life.
- When necessary, they can be empathetic, and when another
  situation demands that they are competetive, they can
  do this as well.
- Androgynous people are argued to be more mentally healthy.

## The BSRI
- Sandra Bem (1974) devised a way of measuring the extent to
  which a person is androgynous. She introduced the idea of
  psychological androgyny and proposed that they are 
  gender-neutral - neither masculine nor feminine with 
  combinations of traits from both sexes.
- Bem argued that the traditional view that rigid sex roles 
  were important for mental heatlth with incorrect and it 
  was actually psychologically more healthy to avoid fixed
  sex-role stereotypes.
- Bem argued that men and women should feel free to adopt to 
  a variety of masculine and feminine type behaviours to 
  suit their personality, i.e. if men enjoyed cooking or 
  being gentle, they shouldn't have to be stifled.

- The aim of the was to examine psychological androgyny and
  provide empirical evidence to show the advantage of 
  shared masculine and feminine personality vs a sex-typed
  categorization.
- The sample was 100 stanford undergraduate students.
- First, Bem compiled a list of 200 personality 
  characteristics that seemed positively valued and 
  stereotypically masculine and feminine, as well as 200 
  gender-neutral characteristics (seemingly neither feminine
  and masculine) which were either negative or positive
  (half and half).
