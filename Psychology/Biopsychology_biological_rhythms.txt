1. Identify and explain two endogenous pacemakers. (4 marks) 

Endogenous pacemakers are internal body clocks which control the 
timing of bodily functions. One endogenous pacemaker is the pineal
gland, which releases melatonin in the evening and night, and it's
responsible for making us feel tired. Another endogenous pacemaker
is the superchiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and it's the body's master 
clock. It's responsible for regulating sleep cycles in animals,
and the reception of light inputs allow it to control the cellular
clocks of the body.

2. Evidence suggests the existence of the 90 minute sleep cycle 
   during sleep. Nathaniel Kleitman (1969) also suggests a similar 
   90-minute cycle during waking hours – he called this the Basic 
   Rest-Activity Cycle (BRAC). Conduct a research and explain what 
   BRAC is using Kleitmans’ study. 



3. Conduct a research on chronotherapeutic, give a clear definition
   and use Beneditti et al. (2007) study to add more information.
