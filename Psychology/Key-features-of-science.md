# Key features of science

- Objectivity - not influenced by personal feelings or 
  opinions in considering and representing facts.

- Replicability - whether or not a study can be repeated to
  obtain a consistent result.

- Falsifiability - the idea that a scientific theory must be
  capable of being proven false through observation or 
  experiment to be considered scientific.

- Scientific research in psychology should be objective, 
  avoiding personal bias.
- Labolatory experiments are the most objective due to their
  high control, while natural experiments, observations, and
  content analysis may be less objective due to limited 
  control and subjective interpretation.
- Empirecal methods involve gaining knowledge through direct,
  systematic and measurable observation, ensuring theories are
  tested and evidence-based, not based on belief or opinion.

## Replicability
- Replicability refers to the ability to conduct research 
  again, in the same way it was conducted originally.
- Replicability allows findings to be repeated for reliability
  to be measured across various studies.
- Replicability also means that research is robost and 
  thorough, especially if they are repeated many times.

## Falsifiability
- Falsifiability (Popper, 1934) refers to the idea that it
  should be possible to 'disprove' a research hypothesis.
    - The emphasis is placed on being able to test the 
      theory.
    - The theories which survive constant and continual 
      testing are therefore the strongest.
- Scientific research can never be 'proven' to be true, only
  subjected to research attempts to prove them false.

## Theory construction and hypothesis testing
- A theory explains behaviours or events, but it must be 
  based on empirical evidence, no belief.
- Using the inductive (bottom-up) approach, researchers 
  collect data first, spot patters, then form a theory.
- In contrast, the deductive (top-down) approach strarts with
  a theory, which leads to a testable hypothesis.

- A theory is constructed using empirical evidence gathered
  via research to support its central assumptions and 
  principles as a theory cannot exist based on beliefs alone
  e.g. 
    - Bandura (1961) designed a controlled observation in
      which children were expossed to an aggressive or an 
      non-aggressive role model; the children were then tested
      for imitative acts of aggression.
- A hypothesis is a prediction of what the researcher expects
  to find after conducting their research.

- The study is then conducted following the hypothesis, i.e.
  what is the central focus of the study and how will the 
  independent variable (IV) and dependent varaible (DV) be
  operationalised in the study?
- When the study's findings have been analysed, a clear 
  decision can be made whether the null hypothesis can be 
  accepted or rejected.

# Paradigms
- A paradigm is a set of shared assumptions, concepts, values,
  and practices that guide how research is conducted within
  a scientific discipline.
- In psychology, it refers to the dominant theoretical 
  framework or approach that shapes what questions are asked
  and how studies are designed and intepreted.

- Kuhn (1962) argued that psychology is a pre-science because
  it lacks a single unifying paradigm, unlike physics and
  biology. He argued that it has too much disparity between 
  its various approaches.
- Scientific progress happens through paradigm shifts, where 
  new ideas replace old ones after growing acceptance.
  Psychology has seen several shifts: from psychoanalysis in
  the late 19th century, to behaviourism in the early 20th 
  century, and then to the cognitive approach in the 1960s,
  reflecting changes in how behaviour is explained.
