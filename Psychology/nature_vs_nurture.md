# Nature vs Nurture

The nature side of the debate is based on the idea that 
human behaviour is innate, the result of heredity.
Then nurture side of the debate is based on the idea that 
environmental influences such as family life, peers, 
education, culture etc. are the key to understanding human 
behaviour.

## Nature
The nature side of the debate assumes that:
1. Behaviour is innate (i.e. people born with a set of 
   characteristics which are 'stamped' into them).
   Evolutionary explanatons suggest that a behavioural 
   characteristic that promotes survival and reproduction will 
   be naturally selected. This is based on Darwin's theory of 
   natural selection.

2. Behaviour is a product of genetic inheretance. Family, 
   twin and adoption studies have shown that the closer people are 
   geneticallly, the more likely that they will develop similar behaviours (e.g. disorders such as schizophrenia and criminal
   behaviours). Behaviour can be understood by studying biological processes.

When looking at the 'nature' approach to studying behaviours it's likely that one or more of the following methods will be
included:
- brain scanning (e.g. fmri),
- concordance rates as used in twin studies,
- DNA analysis via urine or saliva sample.

Heritability coefficient:
The heritability coefficient can be used to determine the extent to which phenotype is determined purely by genotype - or 
by other, external factors.
Genotype: Individual genetic makeup,
Phenotype : Physical characteristics.

Heritability is calculated as a figure ranging from 0 to 1:
- A value of 1 means that the behaviour/trait is purely genetic,
- A value of 0.5 meanst that half the behaviour/trait is genetic and half is determined by environment,
- A value of 0.1 meanst that the behaviour/traits is not genetic and is determined by the environment.

The extreme nature argument suggests that some behaviours are entirely biologically based.
Bowlby's theory of attachment is an example of a pro-nature argument as he based his ideas on the work of ethologists such
as Lorenz, concluding htat attachment is an essential evolutionary mechanism needed for the survival of the species.

Klinefelter syndrome is a chromosome anomaly where a male has
an extra X chromosome. The syndrome is defined by the presense
of at least one extra X chromosome in addition to a Y 
chromosome , yeliding to a total of 47 or more chromosomes 
(compared to the usual 46).
Physcial characteristics include infertility, low levels of 
testosterone. 
Cognitive characteristics include poor language
skills, increased risk of anxierty and poor mathematical 
skills.

Turners syndrome is a genetic condition affecting females 
caused by an absense of an X chromosome. 
It can lead to various health and developmental issues, and it's
characterised by webbed neck, puffy hands and feet, 
underdeveloped ovaries and infertility.
Cognitvie characteristics include average or above average
cognitive ability, visuospacial skills can be impaired,
social adjustment issues.

The discovery of the nAChR nicotinic receptor in the brain
is compelling evidence for a pro-nature explanation of 
nicotine addiction.

### Evaluation of nature
Strenghts:
Understanding genetic inheretance has helped to identify
atypical chromosome patterns as seen in the above conditions.
The is a clear indicator of a biological basis to behaviour as
the condition is not determined by environmental influence, 
therefore the nature side of the debate can be evidenced using
clinical data.

Limitations:
- Using a purely nature-based approach can result in 
  prejudiced, overly deterministic, and possibly dangerous 
  assumptions being made about people based on their gender, 
  ethnicity, sexuality etc. 
    - An example of this is the book 'The bell curve'.
- Twin studies have failed to show 100% concordance between
  monozygous (identical) twins accross a range of studies.

## Nurture
The nurture side of the debate assumes that behaviour is
learned. Behaviour is a product of environmental factos such
as: upbringing, family, peers,  schooling, experience.
Learning occurs via conditioning based on environmental
forces/stimula.

The extreme nurture view suggrests that humans are born as
Locke's 'blank slate' (the basis of hard determinism), ready 
to be 'written on' by life experiences.
The learning theory of gambling addiction is an example of
a pro-nurture argument. It is based on the idea that the 
gambler is positively reinforced in their gambling behaviour.
This is strengthened every time they gamble, even if they lose
money.

### Evaluation of nurture
Stengths:
- The argument that nurture is a key influence on behaviour 
  is evidenced by the two-process model of phobias.
    - This model demonstrates phobias as being learned via 
      classical conditioning.
    - This phobia is reinforced via operant conditioning.
- Twin studies - which are conducted to invesitgate a 
  biological (nature) basis to behaviour - tend to 
  (conversely) support a nature argument as well.
    - Such studies fail to find 100% concordance between MZ
      twins.
    - Concordance rates of around 50% suggest that upgringing 
      and experience share equal importance with genetics in 
      forming behaviour.
    - This bolsters the argument that environmental is a key 
      influence on behaviour as twins are (usually) raised in 
      the same household.

Limitations:
- Although twin studies do not show a 100% concordance rate 
  they are still strong indicators that some behaviours may 
  have a genetic basis.
    - Nan et al (2012) found a 61%-80% concordance rate for 
      obesity in a sample of 8000 MZ twins.
        - Obesity has no relation to psychology, needs another
          example to back up its point.
- The nurture side of the debate cannot account for 
  individual differences within children raised in the same 
  family environment.

Nurture:

Neither: 
> Humanistic approach


## The interactioinst approach
- The interactionist approach is used by most pschologists today when considering the impact of nature-nurture on an individual,
    - Nature does not trumpp nurture (and vice-versa),
    - Nature and nurture interact with each other.
- A genetic predisposition can be moderated or even switched on by the environment as seen in the theory in epigenetics:
     - This refers to how environmental factors can change gene expression.
     - Epigenetics change do not alter the DNA sequence but they can encourage or suppress specific genes from being express e.g:
        - A pregnant woman who undergoes starvation during wartime finds that the baby goes on to be an obese adult compared to
          compared to her other children.
        - Epigenetic changes wrought by starvation during pregnancy changed the expression of genes coding for fat storage in her
          developing child (Tobi et al. 2018).

### Evaluation of the interactionist approach
Strenghts:
- An interactionist approach is more holstic that an extreme nature or nurture approach as it acknowledges the complex 
  relationship between biology, psychology and environment,
    - This is a more valid explanation of behaviour that just nature or nurture alone,
- Constructivism is based on interactionist ideas with its emphasis on people picking environments suited to their natural likes, 
  dislikes, habits and talents.
- Because the interactionist approach considers both the role of nature and nurture, it doesn't really have any limitations.


## Diathesis stess model
- The diathesis stess model suggests that behaviours and disorders arise from teh interaction between an underlying vulnurability
  (diathesis) and external stressors.
- An individaul may have a predisposition to a disorder, but it's the combination of this vulnurability and adverse life events
  that triggers its manifestation.
- Schizophrenia can be explained by the diathesis-stress model. A child may have inhereted the gene from their parents (nature).
- This means that they are predisposed to the gene.
- However, environmental factors, (nature) such as a stressfull life event, may trigger the activation of the gene, which then 
  resuls in a schizophrenic episode.
- There is a growing evidence that the diathesis-stress model offers a more credible explanation for behaviour than looking at 
  genetics and the environment as seperate factors.

### Evalution of the diathesis stress model
- One of the main strenghts of the model is that it takes into account the complex interplay between genetic and environmental
  factors in the development of schizophrenia. This model is supported by a large body of research, which has consistently
  found that individuals with a family history of schizophrenia are at increased risk for developing the disorder themselves.
- However the model also has been criticized for oversimplifying the complex nature of schizophrenia.
